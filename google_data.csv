Under Armour,2024-03-18,"Great toe spread, great cushion and support. Almost feel a spring in my step. Great for the gym too which is why I got them. My feet stay in place when doing planks meaning my toes are not pushing into the floor so no toe cramps. I am glad I got them, I don't run unfortunately but they are great on the stair climber and could easily stand on hard floor for hours in them. My foot is a 12.5 so size 13 worked great although if my foot were an actual 13 I am not sure if they would fit perfect."
Under Armour,2024-03-29,I have several pairs of these shoes in several different colors. Thes shoes are by far the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. I love that they come in a 4 EE because I have a wide foot. I always talked about how comfortable my Sketchers shoes were until I bought these Under Armour shoes. Now they are the only shoes I will wear. They hold up very well and they are nice looking shoes . I would recommend them to everyone.
Under Armour,2023-12-20,"I absolutely love the way these shoes fit, and that means a lot as I have difficulty finding shoes that fit like these. In particular for me the low/neutral arch fits much better than so many shoes with higher arches. And the new generation of the Charged Assert line, which I've been wearing for years, has some great improvements. A wider base and more cushioning from the heel through the toe feels great. I feel like it is even promoting a better roll of my foot from heel to toe as I walk."
Under Armour,2023-06-17,"I need extra wide (4E) fit and have only found a couple shoes that do the job and one discontinued recently. I tried on 4 other brands before I found these gems (my last chance). They felt a little short in the store however I took them home anyways and wore them a little to try them out. I could of lived with them but when I tried 1/2 size larger (10 to 10 1/2) wow I had the right fit!What people mean by 'old man shoes""? Some feet run wide. That is not cool to say that."
Under Armour,2024-01-12,My husband is 6’9” with a size 15 shoe. So shoe shopping for him can be a pain. Finding these in his size with an extra wide option was amazing. He’s worn them almost every day since Christmas. He reports they are super comfy and supportive. 0 complaints at this time. They are also really sharp looking and match most outfits.
Under Armour,2024-03-28,"I was happy to finally get a pair of shoes under the 4E category, however unfortunately this pair seem to hurt my last toes, so it is vlreally uncomfortable when I walk longer distances.I did not have this problem w my earlier pair.It is also not as cushiony as I wld have loved it, unlike New Balance which I tried.Anyway, what can I do to ease the pain on my toes?Thank u"
Under Armour,2024-03-12,"My son is over 6 foot tall and over 300 pounds and the shoe works very well. He’s got a 13 four wide foot which is extremely difficult to fit fits like a glove. He can put them on and take right off with them. There’s no breaking, which I don’t believe is true for shoes anyway they should feel good right off the get-go, but this is probably our Third year that we found under Armour shoes for him and their fantastic"
Under Armour,2024-04-09,I have difficulty with medium width shoes so decided to try these extra wide shoes. A very good fit and styling. I would have prefer a little more cushioning but these shoes are very nice. I would highly prefer that Under Armour offer more color selections in wide and extra wide widths.
Under Armour,2023-11-25,"I ordered the mod Grey size 11, the fit is fine, it seems to run a little small compared to basketball shoes I have from UA, but not much. The reason for the low review is the color of what is on the website, and what I received are not the same. See pictures attached. The website shows a Grey bottom sole, but what I received is a completely white sole."
Under Armour,2023-12-18,This is my second pair of these sneakers. I bought the navy and white pair in a shoe wearhouse store about 2 years ago and they're still in use. I bought this black and white pair in the exact same size from the website and they fit exactly the same and were $25 to $40 less than in the store. Great sneaker.
Under Armour,2023-06-24,"I loved the appearance of these shoes but never was able to wear them. Based on reviews saying the fit was small, I ordered a half-size larger than I normally wear. For the last 40 years, my shoe size was an 8. Once in a while I was forced into an 8 1/2. This was consistently the case. So I ordered a size 8 1/2 in these shoes. They had the tightest and most painful fit of any shoes I have ever put on my feet. The size 8 1/2 shoe was ridiculously small. On the website, I was told I could exchange them only for a black pair. The shoes I ordered were white with orange trim. Fully black was totally unacceptable. I returned them to a local Under Armour Outlet store for a refund. I still don't understand how the company can peddle the shoes being so undersized. I guess I ... MoreI loved the appearance of these shoes but never was able to wear them.

Under Armour,2024-02-25,"Quality:overall, feels goodAppearance:Nice design, but some imperfections on the pair receivedPerformance:comfortableThis is my 2nd purchase from the seller. I ordered on 28 Jan and received on 31 Jan. The shoes fit true to size. They are comfortable to wear and walk in.Some minor imperfections:1. There are some faint scratches or stains on the left toe cap. Hope I can remove them with sneaker cleaner.2. The front tip of the right sole does not appear to be cut in the correct shape.So, I will take away one star for these. Otherwise, I think they are OK and do not affect the overall comfort and performance of the shoes."
Under Armour,2024-03-11,"The Assert 10 shoe arrived earlier than scheduled. It was nicely packaged. The shoe initially felt stiff, but it has a nice & comfortable arch support when worn. I ordered my typical size for underarmour shoes, but this model seems a liitle snug. A half size larger would have been better fit. Its a good looking shoe, However, not quite as pictured; namely color discrepancies ... body of shoe has lighter gray than expected and white soles rather than gray."
Under Armour,2023-05-24,"Based on the reviews a out running small from the previous model, UA Charged Assert 9, I ordered this Charged Assert 10 a half size larger than normal for me. My toes are hitting the end of the shoe and I don’t think ordering a full size larger than normal, 11 vs 10, would provide enough room in length. Too bad because otherwise it is a great looking shoe that otherwise appears to fit well. I can’t recommend due thevsizing issue. Bottom line, order up one size (at least) and I am returning. UA needs to correct this shoe’s sizing issues."
Under Armour,2023-08-14,"cant say it was UA' s fault, but my shoes were delivered 3 days later than FedEx promised. No big deal I guess not like I needed them for a special occasion, still..... The shoes themselves are nice looking but i was a little disappointed in the whiteness of the shoes. The picture I saw on the website seemed not to be so white, afraid it is going to be a little hard to keep them that white. Performance wise, i havent really worn them yet but the rim of the shoe where the bottom of your ankle is, is padded nicely. Overall I like the shoes and will just keep a wet rag and a little soap in a ziplock with me!"
Under Armour,2023-12-16,"I officiate football and wanted to try another brand of sneakers for next season so I purchased this model during the outstanding Black Friday sale. I have never owned Under Armour sneakers before but have gotten positive recommendations from fellow umpires who have been wearing them and I also notice top level officials wearing the brand. Although I haven't worn these shoes in game action yet, these seem comfortable in wearing them around. I am optimistic that these shoes will be comfortable during games next season"

Under Armour,2023-08-10,I purchased the grey and white shoes thinking they looked Grey all around with white and then grey at the bottoms again. The photo is very deceiving in this manner making white look grey. Also the photos make it look like a more athletic shoe and that is not the case. They are much bulkier than I would’ve thought from the pictures as well. Great shoe and does what I need it too but just not what I wanted looks wise at all.

Under Armour,2024-03-15,"These running sneakers have become my go-to for every run. They're incredibly comfortable and provide just the right amount of support, which has made a noticeable difference in my performance. I appreciate the breathable design, especially on longer runs, as it keeps my feet feeling fresh and cool. Overall, these sneakers have made my running experience more enjoyable and consistent."
Under Armour,2023-12-13,"I recently purchased the Under Armour UA Lockdown 6 Basketball Shoes, and I am beyond impressed with their performance on the basketball court. As an avid basketball player, I've worn my fair share of basketball shoes, and these truly stand out.First and foremost, the lockdown fit is exceptional.

The breathability of the materials used keeps my feet cool and comfortable throughout the game.Durability is key for any basketball shoe, and the UA Lockdown 6 does not disappoint. The build quality is robust, and after several intense games, the shoes still look and perform like new.

Under Armour,2023-12-18,"These shoes are nice but have issues. First and foremost, the shoe runs small - for me it is at least a half size small. I just ordered another pair of UA running shoes and these are at least a half size smaller. I had to exchange for the next size up and they are still a touch on the tight size. I am, hoping that the upper loosens up a bit and they will be awesome if that happens.The upper has very little give so right now they are uncomfortable. The base of the shoe is great and comfortable, but narrow and a touch short. I am not sure if that is because they market this as a unisex shoe and have made the outsole smaller to accommodate more smaller feet.The shoe looks great and my fingers are crossed that a break in will include loosening of the uppers.

My feet are 288mm and normally a medium width - look at the lace area - you can see where it is widening out near my leg and you can see how narrow the toe box is of this shoe.If your feet are on the small/narrow side, this could be a great shoe for you. I am 6'1"" and weight 180. Less"
Under Armour,2024-03-16,"I'm a professional trainer and was looking for a pair of shoes that were both comfortable and supportive for a long day on the floor of the gym. I was reluctant to purchase shoes that were advertised as basketball shoes, but liked the design so I gave them a try. They passed the test. I'm a D width and they run just a tad narrow, but they relaxed after a shift at the gym. I wear orthotics and the only downside is the insoles are not removeable. However, they work just fine with my orthotics. The only problem is I wear a 3mm lift in my left shoe, and that combined with the orthotics made the shoe too tights. The ultimate testament is I'm purchasing a back up pair in a different color."
Under Armour,2023-05-09,"I bought these for my daughter and myself for netball as we both have wide feet and other brands are just a smidge too tight. They r brilliant!! So comfortable and fit perfectly. And look good too. I bought them online, although I measured and sized as best I could, I was still a little nervous about getting them before trying them on, but they fit perfectly and very true to size. We have been wearing them for a few weeks now and we love them. I use them for both outdoor and indoor netball and my daughter also uses them for Netball and school sports. We both played our first game in the rain for this season and while everyone else was complaining about there feet soaking and freezing our were warm and dry."
Under Armour,2023-09-22,"Ordered these online to use for boxing workouts. Basketball shoes are often good for boxing, as many of the same foot movements are used. After a couple workouts, these shoes are just about perfect. Good support, especially side to side. The tread pattern is great for pivots. They seem to be good quality, and I like the ankle support, though I do wish it was a half-inch higher. All and all, just what I wanted. And unlike most basketball shows, these are far less than $100."
Under Armour,2023-08-13,"These shoes surprised me. They have a great fit, are built pretty well compared to some other name brands, and the grip has been superb. They have just enough cushion to where they absorb the shock but they dont sink you still get the solid court feel. They dont get overly dusty causing slippage, any ive got was easily wiped off real fast and back to playing. If you want a good shoe for playing basketball and not to show off, you would be pretty happy with these I think.The fit seems right on, if you have average width feet you should just get the size you normally do."
Under Armour,2024-02-06,"I wear these at the range, for tactical training and in my job as a photographer. They are comfortable standing or running around all day on flat or uneven surfaces. They look great with sweatpants, jeans or tactical pants. I have had several pairs and they hold up well. I wish they came in all black, I sometimes paint the white soles. A great UA product. I will continue to wear these for years to come."
Under Armour,2023-05-02,I was looking at these shoes originally for my daughter who had to choose this brand for her team. She looked at many options but kept coming back to these. We ordered a pair and then my son wanted a pair too. The kids like the design and how comfortable they are. My daughter plays competitive basketball and likes the grip better than other brands and appreciates the ankle support. These shoes are unisex and the sizing was perfect both of them.
Under Armour,2023-10-05,"These shoes are dope looking and I was excited to get them, but they are constructed so strangely. First, they run an entire size smaller than any other shoe I've ever bought. Second and most importantly, the arch in the shoe is so far forward (practically in the ball of my foot) that they are painful to wear. I tried exchanging them for a larger size, but had the same issue. Gonna have to admit defeat and just get a refund"
Under Armour,2023-07-22,"First off want to say the color combo ( black with neon green ) is such a great contrast. Secondly these are the most comfortable pair I have ever bought, all UA are top their in comfort but these are by far my favorite yet. They are so nicely made, no mistakes or opps,, they are seemless. I highly suggest these exact style to everyone now. Even bought my whole family their own pairs in different color combos ."
Under Armour,2022-07-08,"Nice fitting shoe. I am using this shoe for a baseball turf. Although this isn't the intended use for this shoe, it works perfectly. The shoe is affordable and sturdy. The drawback I see is this is a running shoe and the one advantage the actual baseball turf shoe has is the aggressive sole that works much better for the baseball field. The overall disadvantage for for me is Under Armour does not make enough shoes available for guys like me in a 4E width shoe. They would get much more business from me if I didn't have to bounce around shoe manufactures looking for the correct shoe size."
Under Armour,2024-02-04,"The shoe is great. The colour is spon on, I have gone for the black and white strip version and it turns out to be great. It is really comfortable while walking and running. Have not tried this in the gym so cant say about that. Overall, great product for the price. Make sure to buy it on deals. I got this for 45 CAD something and overall really satisfied with the product"
Under Armour,2022-07-12,"These shoes are CUTE and let me tell you how I can NEVER find cute shoes for my Husband in a Size 15 Wide! His shoe selection has been SO limited since he hit his teenage years and I FINALLY found a store that not only Carry's his shoe size but also - has clothes that fit him length wise! SO many normal department stores have a 'Big and Tall' section and that has never worked out for us. It's 99% for more larger people - which is fine, but we need some 42, 36's around here! So thankful that I found this store! P.S. He LOVES his new shoes! We'll be shopping here Often!"
Under Armour,2022-12-19,"The main reason I ordered this shoe was for the extra wide size and they do not disappoint. They are comparable to Brooks & Saucony at double the price as I've owned both. The arch support is satisfactory, but I supplement with an insert to get me where I need to be. Note: the insoles of the Charged Assert are glued down if that matters to you. The overall size seems to be true. I bought the light grey and will be ordering the blue as a second set. Additionally, I use these shoes for casual daily wear, not necessarily to workout or run."
Under Armour,2023-05-14,These shoes are my go to pair. Great for running and walking also a stylish casual shoe that fits right. Very comfortable with great support and keep your feet cool. I own 4 pairs of these shoes in different colors. You will not be disappointed with the fit and comfort of this shoe . If you have a wide foot these are for you. Great shoe at a decent price!
Under Armour,2023-05-05,"This is a great workout shoe, the quality is superior, however I think they run small. I take a straight size 9 in dress and casual shoes and sometimes a 9.5 in sneakers / athletic. I found that the 9.5 in these were too small, so I ordered the navy blue in size 10 and they are a perfect fit and very comfortable on my flat feet. So I ordered them in black as well. Can't go wrong."
Under Armour,2023-05-11,This shoe did not disappoint. It was very light and comfortable. It's very comfortable for long walks and mild jogging. I would recommend this shoe to anyone. This is a nice looking shoe. You can not find a better shoe for the price. I was so satisfied with the shoe that I bought two more pair.
Under Armour,2024-03-17,"These shoes are nice, but unfortunately they were a bit too tight for me. I normally wear men's size 9, these run about a 1/2 size smaller. I decided not to return them, rather maybe sell them locally. Otherwise I would keep them, it was a good deal. Team town did a great job in sending them, I received them quickly."
Under Armour,2023-04-27,"I had been eyeing these shoes for a while because they looked so comfortable. They did not disappoint! The super foam makes them great for all day anything! I have never owned a pair of UA, but found them to run small. I typically wear a size 8, but returned them to Academy and ordered a size 8.5. They fit, but I would might even go for a size 9."
Under Armour,2023-07-05,"We liked the fact that the sole is black. It it is white, it get within days the dirty look. These ones are relatively resilient to ear and tear. Keep in mind this is the extra wide width. Had to reorder in the regular width. Return was quick and seamless."
Skechers,2024-03-02,"Skechers slip on shoes are awesome !. as someone with back issues it makes putting on shoes a breeze. and as with all Skechers shoes, they are super comfortable. I use these for outdoor use, in my shop, and it is very convenient to have slips on when coming in and out of the house frequently. Also, Skechers shoes are always comfortable right out of the box !! Highly recommended"
Skechers,2023-08-18,"I haven't had these long but I'm a fan of Skechers so I'm sure they will be good. The right shoe is a little loose (something I haven't experienced with Skechers before) so I think the back of the shoe may wear out prematurely. When I first tried them on I couldn't ""slip in"" to the left shoe. Since then it has loosened up a bit. It's great to have slip-in shoes, however, it would be nice to have laces to tighten them."
Skechers,2023-10-07,I have normal feet and these fit length and width just fine. However they are so tight across the top and caused so much pain I can't wear them. Not to mention they are the noisiest shoes I've ever worn. It sounds like you have an octopus on both feet when you walk sucking the ground. My last purchase of Skechers shoes.
Skechers,2024-04-01,"I bought this a few weeks ago and soon after bought more in other colors. They are padded, but not so padded that they are overly cushey which i prefer. I also like the look/style. I was also happy that they came in extra wide."
Skechers,2024-03-04,"Have been wearing these daily for almost a year, including miles of walking in Britain for a month. Still super comfortable, and showing little signs of wear. Got another trip to Iceland coming up in August and I'll be buying a new pair for that."
Skechers,2023-08-24,"Shoes arrived on time and packaged well. Fit is good and they are easy to slip on. They call the color brown but, they are more a khaki color. Would recommend."
Skechers,2023-05-22,These slip on sketchers are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. I recently had two hip replacements so not having to bend down is a blessing. The only negative thing I have is that shipping took way too long.
Skechers,2024-02-25,I got these for my husband. They were extra wide. He usually just wears a wide. He complained that they were too tight. So I had to return them .
Skechers,2023-09-19,I have purchased 2 pair of shoes now. I keep one for going out and one for everyday wear. I love the comfort the most.
Skechers,2023-12-04,My second pair and I have tried several manufacturers . Fits securely to my wide foot in the wide size. This is the best slip in mechanism of all.
Skechers,2023-11-21,"I heard great things about this sneaker, but unfortunately it did not work for my Dad. My Dad saw these on TV and he really wanted to try them out. However, my Dad has a disability and is in a wheelchair. So he thought a slip-on sneaker would be great for him. So I went and got him a size 8.5, his normal shoe size, but I had to return them because he couldn't even put his foot inside. So I went back to get a bigger size, a 9.5. This size actually fitted him perfect, but he still wasn't satisfied because he couldn't actually slip them on without a struggle. So I guess you have to be standing up in order to slip them on, which was really hard for my Dad. So unfortunately I had to return them."
Skechers,2023-12-14,"This is a super comfortable shoe. It fits me basically dead on, and it's nice that we can dispense with the idea that I'm tying shoes every day and not just jamming my feet in using the heel as a shoe horn every day - and this shoe is specifically designed for that. They are very, very comfortable. I'm on my feet all day and I feel great all day. They also breath really well.The only downside is they are fully cloth - which is great for how much airflow you get and how light the shoe ends up being, but if you have to walk in wet grass or puddles your feet will be soaked, so keep spares around or choose different shoes on rainy wet days."
Skechers,2023-08-21,"I've spent a fortune searching for perfect pair of shoes for my husband. You can no longer bend over due to back issues. He Steffens suit him perfectly and he can manage on his own. My only observation is do we have to have the step in words on the side so that it advertises for everybody that, he's unable to get his shoes on. I would much rather have just seen sketchers on the shoe. As for durability and length of time that they will last, we will have to wait and evaluate that as we go .Price bit of an issue, hoping you have substantial sales occasionally so that we can order more."
Skechers,2023-08-20,"I was hesitant at first because I am plagued with peripheral neuropathy and most shoes have proven very difficult, if not almost impossible for me to enter. BUT the words used to advertise the Sketcher Slip-ins are certainly not exaggerations. They are easy to ""put on"" initially and provide a comfortable way to walk. Nothing is ever perfect but these shoes are as close to perfect as I ever expect to find. Finally I can put on my own shoes!"
Skechers,2023-06-11,"I love Skechers! I have them and have been wearing them for years. But with these slip-ons I can not slip my feet in! They are too tight, yes once on they fit, a bit tight but they do fit. But the point was to be able to slip them on because I have knee issues. I just wish I had known so I would of ordered a full size larger.I would only recommend them if someone is able to try these slip-ind on in a Skechers store first for sizing."
Skechers,2023-11-10,My husband would never listen to me about buying shoes. He would always get cheap tennis shoes. I decided to get him these shoes because he was having a hard time getting his shoes in and off. I am so happy that he must love them. He wears them everywhere we go. They not only look nice they are easy on. They are great shoes and worth every cent.
Skechers,2023-11-15,"I had heard so much about Skechers footwear and had several people recommend them to me. I made my purchase after seeing Willie Nelson wears themðŸ˜‰ and I'm glad I did. I really like the fit (they come in half sizes), they're stylish, very lightweight and easy on the pocketbook. I recommend them to everyone. I'm definitely going to purchase more Skechers!"
Skechers,2024-03-20,"comfortable and practical footwear that made my life easier after receiving a full hip replacement. Very easy to slip in and out of. They were reduced which made them affordable, I wouldnâ€™t have paid full retail. Iâ€™m a true size 11. The box they came in said UK14 and the shoe itself said UK10, but they are a perfect fit, so hats off to Pavers for knowing they run on the large side."
Skechers,2023-05-20,"I have a bad back, so I was looking for a lite shoe with good support I can wear around the house. These are perfect. I never take them off, sometimes I forget I have them on. To me the seizing is a bit off, I had to order half a smaller. Bottom line Very comfortable shoe, hope they last. Would definitely buy again."
Skechers,2024-01-14,I bought this shoe a few weeks ago and I wear them all the time! I'm currently looking at other colors!You do literally slip right into them and they have a good arch support and cushioning. I bought them for cushioning as it's what Skechers is known for. You will not be disappointed!
Skechers,2023-12-29,"I was worries about the shoes getting loose (since there are no laces) however the shoes are nice and snug around the ankles. I don't know how they will be a few months from now, but the build quality seems to suggest I will not have to worry.I almost always wear shoes without tying them up. It is nice to have shoes actually made for that.I will definitely buy Skechers Slip-Ins again."
Skechers,2023-09-25,I love these shoes! They are very comfortable and look very sporty. The slip on feature is fantastic and really is a great feature especially for those with issues bending over or back issues. I would definitely recommend these shoes.
Skechers,2023-09-19,I work long hours in urgent care. These are comfortable on my feet. I love how I can move around in them. I almost never want to take them off. Highly recommend these shoes to everyone.
Skechers,2023-11-19,I've been looking for a couple of pear of slip-ons and I have found a few of them by Snoop. I'm hoping that they are available for purchase when I have the funds to purchase them. I am planning to purchase 2 or 3 pair ðŸ¤”.
Skechers,2024-02-01,Very good salesman and knowing what we were looking for.Will be going back.I think his name was Garrett very pleasant.Thanjs again
Skechers,2023-11-11,Husband just loves sketchers and I showed him the slip ons- he wasnâ€™t too sure of them but I ordered him a pair and hasnâ€™t stopped wearing them!
Skechers,2023-11-04,I found and tried on these slip - one at a local store but they were $95.00. Your price was much better and more reasonable
Skechers,2024-02-22,My husband wears a 12 extra wide! So thankful you carry them - he goes through 2-3 pairs a year!
Skechers,2023-12-29,I purchased these for my husband Xmas gift he couldnâ€™t belive they were so comfortable.
Skechers,2024-02-02,I got these for my husband on Tuesday and he loved them
Skechers,2023-08-18,"I bought these for my husband at his request. He loves these shoes, they are easy to slip on and very comfortable. He said he is very happy with the fit and feel of these shoes. He wears a size 11 wide, they are true to size. He noticed a little wear on the toe but this is something you might expect with a summer fabric shoe with use. The no hands slip on feature is what most appealed to him. I would buy these again."
Skechers,2024-02-04,I bought these shoes about 5 months ago they fit well. I walk a lot in these not the most comfortable soles but they lasted longer than my Nike monarchs and about as long as the new balance walking shoes. I can't really complain about the shoes for the price to value I got out of them. The only complaint I have is the soles are too thin or they wore really thin when I was using them these are a decent walking shoe that I have put a lot of work into
Skechers,2023-12-16,"This is the third pair I bought from Academy. I had to return the other two because they were not as described. This pair was what I wanted, but it doesn't fit well. It angers me that I had to make three trips to buy one pair of shoes, which I am not satisfied with. If the store had these in stock, I would have been able to purchase the right fit in one trip. I like Academy, but I will not be buying shoes there anymore."
Skechers,2023-05-09,I have been wearing Skechers shoes for years and find them very lightweight and comfortable. I have just had a hip replacement and needed help with putting my shoes on. I ordered a pair of these Skechers slip-ins and they are absolutely amazing. So easy to put on and take off and extremely comfortable also very stylish. I love these shoes and will certainly be buying more of them.
Skechers,2024-01-02,"I purchased these Skecher shoes for my husband. He usually orders very wide shoes (6e) from a company that specializes in wide shoes. He was surprised to discover these relaxed fit, extra wide Skechers were very comfortable and wide enough. I hope DSW will continue to carry more relaxed fit extra wide Skecher shoes."
Skechers,2023-11-24,Was looking for an extra wide shoe. Found this and tried it on. Very comfortable feel. OnceOut of store placed then one and did some more shopping. Night and day difference in the shoes I had. Highly recommend if looking for a slip on shoe.
Skechers,2023-12-09,"Purchased these for my elderly father who has difficulty putting shoes on. Easy to step in to and take off. Has an extra wide foot & high arch. Most comfortable shoe he’s had in a long time. Very lightweight, so easier to walk in. Comes in a variety of fabrics"
Skechers,2024-02-19,"My husband's shoes are always medium width. The width of this shoe is narrow for him. Also, the bottom of the shoe does not have enough cushion. I ended up returning this shoe. However, it's a good price (clearance item)."
Skechers,2023-08-14,I ordered these Skechers Parson Moc-Toe shoes in a wide size even though I normally wear D. They slip on super easy and stay on. They wear very comfortably. I have since ordered a different style Slip-In Skechers in a D size and they do not slip in near as easily. I am Very happy with both pair.
Skechers,2023-05-23,"Bought this three weeks ago. Very comfortable and easy to slip into (be careful to get ""slip-ins"" not ""slip-ons"").The sizes run large with the wide styles; normally a 9, got 8 1/2.Great looking and have sent a couple of friends to DSW to get them.Great for elderly."
Skechers,2024-03-04,"I recently purchased a pair of shoes online, and I initially ordered my usual size 11. However, upon receiving them, I quickly realized they were too small. Disappointed, I returned them and opted for a size 12 instead.Thankfully, the size 12 fit perfectly! I must admit, I was a bit surprised since I typically wear size 11 in all my other shoes. It seems there's a sizing discrepancy with this particular brand or style. Despite this initial setback, I'm glad I gave them another chance by exchanging for a larger size.Once I had the right fit, I found these shoes to be excellent.

Skechers,2023-07-03,"I hardly ever endorse any product but these are amazing. I had a badly strained Achilles tendon/heel. Within 3 days of wearing these, that affliction dissipated. Wear them barefoot (so socks) for a few days so your feet will ""form"" within the shoe. I take 11.5 however these are 11 and feel and fit great. I would suggest 1/2 a size down from your normal size as there is some ""give"" to them but they do not ""baff"" out like other soft shoes., Love the step-in feature. Mostly because I am not only lazy but also old and fat. Buy these! You will not regret it."
Skechers,2024-04-01,"Bought for my Husband, SO GLAD I DID. My husband has bad feet and is very fussy about his shoes. These are very easy for him to get on and off and do not hurt his feet. Love the color looks get with Jeans or slacks, I Would recommend these."
Skechers,2023-11-23,"Kingsize turned me onto Sketchers Slip-in Canvas shoes and they Rock! Ultimate comfort, durability and fit.Only at Kingsize could i find the Size 13 EE shoes I needed and with speedy delivery and fair pricing...JBW"
Skechers,2024-02-18,"These shoes are very comfortable and fit well. Sizing is accurate. Soles are Goodyear rubber, which should stand up well. Love the slip in technology."
Skechers,2023-07-07,Slip-ins are a great product. No bending down no shoehorn required. Comfortable with great support. I've purchased two pairs so far.
Skechers,2023-09-13,My husband is having bilateral knee replacements shortly and knew that he would need a shoe that was extremely easy to put on. THIS IS IT! WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE SHOES FOR ANYONE!
Skechers,2024-01-28,Very comfortable and has good support. I have trouble putting my shoes on so these are what I needed. Very easy to slip into. Wears them all the time.
Skechers,2024-03-06,"The Sketcher slip ins arrived quickly, they were well made, a lovely style and colour and great value . Unfortunately the fit wasn’t quite right but we managed to find some very similar ones in store."
Skechers,2023-11-10,"I have ALS, and needed a better slip-on shoe than the New Balance ones I had which had no heel portion and were very dangerous. These Skechers are fantastic in that regard, and loads of traction."
Skechers,2023-04-26,"I got these shoes for work. I stand much of the day on hard slippery floors. I thought these would be the perfect shoe for working in the summer.

Skechers,2023-04-20,"I work at a coffee shop. Was looking for a non-slip shoe option with some water resistance in case of spills. The show itself feels a little wide in the toes with odd arch support placement. The non-slip is perfect and the outer material has so far kept minor spills from seeping inside the inner shoe. I am likely going to purchase a third-party insert, as the provided memory foam lacks sufficient comfort when working an 8 hour shift."
Skechers,2023-05-26,"These shoes are great! I purchased them as work shoes. Bus driver here. They feel really good on my feet. They are highly breathable, which was a must for me. Lastly I was pleasantly surprised by the durability. I've worn them to work every day for a year and they still look and feel great. So much so I bought a 2nd pair...which are in the closet waiting for my current pair to wear out."
Skechers,2024-02-03,My husband works as a parts driver and also customer service. He will be 65 this year. He started with more of a work boot and compared these shoes with “ they feel light as a feather”. They also brush off well as he delivers to some muddy garages. Can’t wait for them to go on sale again and I’ll grab him a backup pair. No laces either to deal with. He slips them on and the laces are kind of bungee material and snug onto your feet.
Skechers,2019-06-25,"These work shoes are a life saver! Every other pairs of work shoes I have bought in the past now feel like a waste of my money. Because of how comfortable these shoes are to wear (especially since I can wear 11.5 in these compared to the size my foot has apparently grown into even as an adult now.) how they have no shoe lashes needed to tie, so they come on easily like a glove, have not had any holes or tears since wearing them to walk and walking. They’re all black and look so nice that coworkers have commented to me how nice they look and where I bought them so they can look into buying a pair.

P.s After two months of of putting these to work at a restaurant where I put away the truck, cook, clean and more they still look great! These can even work as good gym shoes, running shoes and causal shoes. Less"
Skechers,2020-05-24,"Agree with a prior review. The insole fabric literally starts coming up after a week or 2. Otherwise I love this shoe. I deliver for Fedex and log 10 miles per day, give or take. I've reordered this shoe for a few years now ever since it came out. Looks great, very comfortable and very durable. Aside from the insoles, the shoe barely ages. The non-slip tread lasts for at least 8-9 months for me, impressive considering how much I walk. The insoles are the only reason for a 4 star review vs 5. Otherwise this shoe is perfect. Also, and this does not factor into my rating but just an FYI, these run big numerically. I wear a 10.5 in every other shoe brand, but a 9.5 in Skechers and surprisingly a 9 in this particular shoe.

Skechers,2022-12-27,"I bought the shoes for work. I am a bartender and I work at a very busy bar. I’ve been having trouble with my shoes because I’ve recently gotten gout, that has left my foot continuously sore for some reason. These shoes have been incredibly comfortable . I’ve had them for less than a week and have had little issues with my feet. The shoes are snug but very stretchable. Super happy with them!!"
Skechers,2021-03-23,"I bought this shoe because my old shoes were raggedy and falling apart. I am very picky about shoes because I am a Type-I Diabetic, and also drive a manual transmission vehicle. For me, the shoe has to be solid enough to avoid any injuries to my feet, but also breathable enough to ensure proper moisture wicking. It also needs to be narrow and flexible enough to press a clutch pedal in a smaller vehicle. This shoe, while a little bit expensive, checks all of those boxes. It is comfortable to wear and is very light, with good tread. It drains water well, so well in fact that they dried about as fast as boating shoes after being submerged in river water while kayaking and seem no worse for wear."
Skechers,2020-08-24,"Terrible shoes. I am a Hospitality manager, constantly running around the restaurant and kitchen. These shoes make my feet feel worse that any other pair of work shoes I have owned. I have purchased expensive skechers work shoes before was pleased but these are awful. I should have guessed they would be bad shoes since they cost half of what other skechers work shoes cost. Yes are no slip but that is it for benefits. They dont breathe and they started falling apart day 1.Wish i had not bought them for myself and staff. Skechers quality has deteriorated in the last few years. They used to be great shows and lasted a long time. Not any more!!!Trefsafe are a better option and a better price!"
Skechers,2019-10-02,"Lightweight, breathable, heel support, slip resistant and affordable. Feels like a sneaker which is fantastic when you spend hours on your feet baking.

Puma,2023-10-07,"I wore these sneakers for 3 years and was completely satisfied! This time I decided to order this model again, but in a different color. THIS TIME IT'S HORROR! Sneakers of terrible quality! There are traces of glue on the shoes, a damaged sole, the Puma emblem is painted in the color of the sole! After the first day of wear, the sole wore off! This is some kind of horror! If I lived in the USA, I would definitely return it! Definitely not recommended!"
Puma,2023-04-20,"These ST Runner V3 SD shoes in Forest Night are BEAUTIFUL! They’re a little darker than they appear in the photo, but that’s okay. They’re EXACTLY what I was looking for style-wise. But unfortunately they run a little too narrow for my foot. I’m going to have to return them. At this point, I’m not interested in “breaking in” shoes. I just want to slip them on and go in comfort from the start. The shoes are so well made that they may never not be too tight. So unfortunately, back they go."
Puma,2023-11-11,"Bought these thinking they would be great for work. Wrong. An hour into my shift, the left one had become so uncomfortable that I could feel a blister forming on the bottom of my foot. It felt as though there was something in there besides my foot. I even tried different insoles, to no avail. I'm glad I was able to get a cheap pair of sneakers to replace them. This pair will go to the local shelter... I'm sure someone there will like them."
Puma,2023-11-22,"Website says to buy a half size larger because these run small. So I did and they were way too big. Also, too narrow and tight. The tongues are very uncomfortable. The two shoes looked different one from the other. Low quality control I guess. Returned for refund but will lose $8.00 shipping charge. Hardly worth it."
Puma,2023-11-22,"I feel the clothing industry has decided to construct their items to the smallest size standards mandated by law. What does this mean? A nine and a half shoe is barely a nine and a half, a large shirt is barely a large, etc. Puma apparently is no different. My shoes only fit after I loosened the laces so much that there was barely enough lace left to tie a knot. Even then, they are still snug. I will try to find someone who usually wears an 8 and a half or nine and give them away."
Puma,2023-07-15,"I came upon the ST Runner v3 while researching for a good all around sneaker.The reviews from various web sites were mainly very positive on the ST Runner, which convinced me to purchase one. Thus far I have found the she to be fairly comfortable but a bit narrow. Hopefully a break in period will overcome thatissue. Time will tell pertaining to the longevity of the shoe."
Puma,2024-01-09,I bought these a month ago and I really like them. They are smaller than my other shoes that are listed as the same size but all the reviews said that as driving shoes they would be tight. I actually have no need for driving shoes so I use these as indoor shoes. Think half way between go anywhere trainers and slippers and you get the picture. Also I got them on a 60%off sale so even better. The best part - not made in China.
Puma,2023-05-12,Love the colors and style but this shoe hurts! I'm a woman and I usually wear a 7 or 7.5 in men. Being that I have other Puma shoes similar to these I ordered the 7.5 but they don't fit like the other Puma shoes I have in 7.5. They felt like a size 6 to me (I even checked the size to make sure). I'll definitely will be returning. Brought for an great price but the fit was horrible. I'm a huge PUMA fan and this shoe was really disappointing.
Puma,2023-05-27,"I’ve been wearing Size 13 for 30+ years and these shoes are a tight fit. I’d exchange for a 14 but they’re all sold out now. The leather may relax a bit after a few wears, so I’ll stick with them. Also, the shoe lace length supplied with the shoe are comically short. When I was able to tie them they looked like a Smurf’s bow tie. Good looking shoe, but I’m a bit disappointed none the less - The $49.99 sale price lessens the sting, though."
Puma,2024-01-11,"The con:-Probably the narrowest sneaker I have seen. Even after sizing up, it is snug in toebox and pinches my pinky toe. Not a good option for people with wide feet.The pro:-The insole and sock liners are padded and comfy. The suede looks nice during the initial months or for as long as you can keep them clean."
Puma,2024-03-14,Hard pass on this shoe. Super disappointed - sizing is way off about a size and a half small. Cheap super thin “leather” and the rubber sole is awful - only about 1/8” thick. No footbed or support. Returning asap.
Puma,2024-02-28,I had high hopes for these puma sneakers. I like the color and over all look of the shoes. It is the materials they are made from that fall short. The sole is thin and with normal ware toe bend areas will be ripped in no time. I returned them.
Puma,2024-04-06,I bought these knowing Puma trainers are a little bit tighter on sizes so went one size up .Lovely quality and so comfortable even on first wear.Relatively cheap compared to other brands of similar quality
Puma,2023-12-08,I LOVE these sneakers re their style and looks. Very regrettably after I bought them I learned they were not made out of leather but vinyl and they are really stiff and really hurt my feet.
Puma,2024-04-04,"Personally, I love shoes and the fact I was able to buy a well-designed. I’m very comfortable pair of new white trainers at an exceptional price Was always a plus side."
Puma,2024-03-30,Takes a day or two to break them in but after that they are super comfortable. The go great with every outfit and are a little dressier than your typical trainers
Puma,2024-03-21,Similar to Pumas I purchased years ago but were not since available for purchase.
Puma,2024-03-22,"I’m so happy with these shoes, so comfy! A good alternative if you want Adidas samba!"
Puma,2024-03-21,"Very pretty, very comfortable, true to the size trainers."
Puma,2024-04-06,Love the trainers puma always make fantastic looking clothing
Puma,2024-03-30,"Shoes are fat looking, I previously bought this same brand about two years ago and they were wonderful to use to run on the treadmill.Unfortunately, these shoes are clumsy and difficult to wear when doing a light jog on a treadmill. Personally, I really don't seeany reason for anyone to buy these shoes, they are not chic, and they surely aren't something to use for exercise. Not sure ifPuma changed the design on these shoes in the last few years, but I would recommend not buying them. I have used Pumashoes for nearly two decades, but now, I'm looking for a new brand that doesn't sell products that don't meet their description.I have already worn the shoes, so can't return them, lesson learned on my part."
Puma,2024-03-28,"I really like this shoe because it increases my versatility in that I can slip these on quickly and feel relatively satisfied that my feet are protected and ready. I'd been looking for a slip on, so to see one from my favorite shoe brand was exciting. I am called Mr. Puma around here so to boast this slide on was super cool. The only thing I would ask for in the 2nd generation is a shoe that caters to my pronation issues and perhaps a slightly snugger fit. But I am more than pleased with this versatile shoe and it fits right in with the other hundred pair of puma in my closet."
Puma,2023-11-30,Love the look of these shoes and my boys say they are comfortable. The negative points are the toe separated from the sole after one day of school on one of the shoes and second an entire size down was sent to me from what I ordered. I needed these shoes asap for my son but luckily I order a size up for room to grow.The price was great. Overall I would buy from Puma again. Shipping was also quick!
Puma,2024-03-21,I purchased these shoes for my son who is super active and always running or on the go. He absolutely loved them !! Lightweight but not cheap made ! After a full day of wear he has no complaints!
Puma,2024-03-27,"Shoes are extremely comfortable, however the build quality is lacking. Shoe started to separate after about two weeks around the toe. If they weren't on sale I'd stay away in the future."
Puma,2024-03-02,Once AGAIN! PUMA has over exceeded my expectations! This is the second pair I've bought because of the extreme comfort and fit!
Puma,2024-04-09,"Bought these sneakers for my son for Easter. He hates tying his shoes, so these were just perfect for him! He absolutely loves him!"
Puma,2024-03-26,"Fantastic shoes so comfortable, and after I received them I was headed out on vacation did lots of walking, no troubles with these shoes my wife had blisters from her shoes and mine nothing but comfort love them cheers thx again"
Puma,2024-03-26,Extremely light and comfortable shoes! I decided to give these shot for cardio and I’m so glad I purchased them!
Puma,2023-12-31,"Shoes were simply superb definitely worth, only recommendation is to buy .5 size bigger than normal."
Puma,2023-10-12,"I'm an old Gen X'er who is a stickler about white shoes.

Puma,2023-10-21,I can't say enough good things about Finish Line. This is my 2nd of 3 pairs of sneakers that I've bought online from Finish Line and each one has been just as good if not better than the last. I got a pair of Nike '77 hightops that are awesome. I then bought this pair of Puma for the gym. They look so nice and they are super comfortable and I got a great sale price. It took no time at all for them to arrive. Because of my great experience so far I went ahead and bought a new pair of dark blue Nike Air lowtops that arrived last night. They looked so good that I took them out of the box and am wearing them now. I got a great sale price on all 3 pairs and I used AfterPay to pay for them so I barely feel the financial pinch at all. Very Happy Shopper.Thanks!!
Puma,2023-11-23,"I ordered a size 8, which is my size. I have several pair of Puma in this style. This pair has a slight defect in one shoe that is visible. The toe curves downward. I entered a return and would like a replacement. To err on the side of caution, I was going to have the replacement a half size up, just in case this toe curve is present in the replacement pair. According to customer service, I have to place a new order at a HIGHER price than what I originally paid PLUS pay shipping again. I will return the DEFECTIVE shoes and not order from Puma again. It’s a shame, because I was a fan of their products, but defects should not be on my dime."
Puma,2023-09-12,"My first best high end running show was Puma. I ran in them for training, in the weight room, and to practice and in all soccer matches except for flooded muddy pitches. After those wore out I couldn’t find a replacement. I went to Sambas. I am working to get back in shape post Covid and ordered Sambas… they’re not at all like the old lath. I couldn’t wear them, they hurt my feet! I found Pumas that looked like my first pair. I ordered them, tried them on… they fit like a glove! Light weight, supportive, strong… so much so I ordered another pair. They also fit me perfectly! I am grateful! Thank You Puma!"
Puma,2023-11-18,"I love the design of this shoe. It's quite different from other shoes and this really stands out. The colors are great and the the shoe fits like a glove on me at my usually athletic shoe size (a half size up from regular shoes). The design and colors take the shoe away from the the thick ,wide, white marshmellow like soles of the average shoe design. These shoes are quite stable for my weight lifting workout yet are quite walkable and I could run in them if needed. The way they are laced allows you to tighten up the shoe at any point along your foot."
Puma,2023-08-23,"I bought the shoes for the look and color scheme. I have a couple pairs of Puma, and they have always been comfortable, so I wasn't too worried about the fit. First time I wore my new Axelion's ended up being unexpectedly all day on my feet walking around. After which I could not have been happier with my decision to wear my Axelion's. They were beyond comfortable. The cushion of the sole had a walking on air feeling. Very happy with this purchase. Once again Puma does not disappoint."
Puma,2023-08-11,I bought this same pair of shoes two years ago. The softness and comfort of the shoes is noticeable from the first step. The mesh material soaks up water like a sponge. Dont wear in the rain or wet grass. I have a different pair of pumas i wear when raining. The old version had a blue stripe in plastic that emmediately tore when the shoe flexed.This new pair has changed that plastic out for suade and it should last a lot longer. Love Axelion I will probably buy more
Puma,2022-10-21,"I ordered these for my boyfriend, as he couldn't find a 13 Wide in any stores near us. Figured basic shipping would take several days, but didn't want to pay to upgrade to 2 day or next day. I ordered October 17th, they shipped on the 19th and were here by the 20th. They were in perfect condition and he said they felt very comfortable, but ran big. He normally wears a 14 wide, but has tried on other styles and decided on a 13 Wide. They are still a little long, but when he previously tried on a 12 they were too small. I really wish there were more options available in Wide in this style though, as he would destroy white shoes quickly and didn't love the all black, but he says they fit well enough he will definitely wear them.I was impressed with the fast processing ... MoreI ordered these for my boyfriend, as he couldn't find a 13 Wide in any stores near us.

Puma,2023-06-17,"I bought a pair of this same Puma Axelion shoe 5 years ago and they lasted a long time. This this is an excellent shoe comfortable and lightweight, and excellent value for the price paid. Will buy again. Great speedy, accurate service from Finish Line too. Will order the next pair from Finish Line again, they are quick and accurate not like a certain company named for a river in South America, go with Finish Line for shoes as to not lose your money in that river."
Puma,2024-01-06,Bought these for a Christmas present to myself. Such a great shoe and the price was unbeatable. I buy only PUMA. It was a great purchase. Thanks for making a shoe that does not look like its 3 inches thick LOL. Oh by the way the sole grip to my vehicle brake pedal and gas pedal is really great. I don't think many people would acknowledge that. It is a very good safety feature.
Adidas,2024-01-10,I did originally buy these thinking they would be a running shoe. I would not recommend them for that. Even though it has boost cushioning it feels a little firm. The shoe itself is also very straight and not contoured to a foot the way most running shoes are. However the I switched gears and started wearing these to work in... I actually started liking them. Appearancewise they look dope. So I would say it depends on your expectations whether or not you ultimately like this shoe.
Adidas,2023-10-08,The shoes were exactly what I expected There were a few reviews I read before purchasing them that stated that the size recommendation would be one size below your current size. I’m not entirely sure if this is accurate what I will say is that I’ve purchased several Adidas shoes and I currently still have Adidas shoes that are 11 and 10 1/2 and the shoes were a 10 1/2 so they fit as I would have expected.
Adidas,2023-10-17,"I bought these as a pair of around town sneakers. I had knee surgery earlier this year and the cushioning and support are nice. I wouldn't pay full price, but at a discounted rate I think it's worthwhile."
Adidas,2024-01-15,"They seem comfortable but to big. I read the reviews after I purchased these, and you do indeed need atleast a half size smaller. I sent mine back and it's been a week and I haven't heard anything about my replacements."
Adidas,2023-10-20,"Bought not too long ago and was skeptical due to the fit - go down half a size, you will thank me. I was fortunate and read prior reviews. Great heel support, super soft step that molds to you and they look awesome 👌🏼"
Adidas,2023-12-06,"Uncomfortable, heavy, badly designed and painful to wear. I wore them several times to see if I could break them in, but they just got worse, which is a pity because I cannot return them. Donated to charity."
Adidas,2023-03-30,"I wear a woman’s 10 in just about everything. So I bought the men’s 9, which is supposed to correspond with a women’s 10, and it’s HUGE. I can fit an entire finger behind my heel. Love the way these look but they’ll absolutely be going back."
Adidas,2023-09-07,Beautiful in really nice. Well worth the price. Thankyou..
Adidas,2023-10-15,You left the Alarm 🚨 things on the shoes I my shoes got damaged while trying to get it off. Terrible service on your part👎🏾.

Adidas,2024-01-05,"Ordered for self and spouse 2 types of sneakers and while they are comfortable, there is little support - o can nearly feel the floor. My main issue that white are not actual leather and the feel is plastic-ish. Suede (green) stated that it’s leather or real suede, yet compared to other adidas shoes, it feels contrary to the label. Mine had uneven toe details. Bottom line: just ok. It’s not worth the discount."
Adidas,2023-10-31,"I bought these as I was looking for a Sambas style shoe at a cheaper price point. Adidas usually runs large on me but I found this to be true to size, and actually a little on the snug side. These aren’t the most comfortable sneaker so far - I’ve found my toes feel a little sore due to lack of support. I’m hoping they will get more comfortable and/or I just won’t use them when I’ll be walking too much. Overall a decent alternative although I wouldn’t pay full price."

Thank you and will definitely order again 😊"

Adidas,2024-03-14,"During live selling, I ask if we can request for a replacement if the shoes doesnt fit well. They said yes and asures replacement can be made. However, as per customer service, it is not allowed by shoppee. They have contradicting rules. I think they need to be honest when it comes to it to avoid dissappointment."
Adidas,2023-11-25,I bought these trainers for a Christmas present! They are so worth the money! Great style! Amazing quality! Fits perfectly- order your normal shoe size! Definitely recommend this product!
Adidas,2023-12-29,"The size is spot on for a 5'11"" guy who wears US size 10 on most brands. I wear these sneakers to office on weekdays and likewise on weekends. Versatile, looks decent and mature to be worn by an adult male. Mine is the black faux leather on brown soles."
Adidas,2024-03-09,"Purchased for husbands birthday and he loves them. I picked them mainly for the colour, but they are surprisingly comfortable for a flat trainer. They are his favourite trainers at the moment and teamed with matching coloured hoodie they look very smart but casual."
Adidas,2024-03-15,Quality:original qualitySuitability:niceAppearance:niceThe item has been shipped for a while but all is well. I like the fit and its aesthetic. Keep it up guys.
Adidas,2023-04-24,"Good trainers, I bought a pair of size 10s and I really liked them but thought they might be a bit loose for a slip on and wondered if I should go a size down. After a day or so I decided they were perfect as is. Anyway I went to buy another pair of these and they were sold out but I’d check back every so often as I really wanted another pair and as luck would have it a pair of size 10s showed up and I brought. Funny enough a pair of size 9 1/2 were delivered so I got to see which pair was best. While the size 9 1/2 do fit me the 10 I have fit better for sure, so stick to your usual size. The trainer is comfortable, I like the slip on aspect, I do think they may wear down fairly quickly on the sole and perhaps that is reflected in the price. Anyway I love them"
Adidas,2023-05-28,"It’s very hard for me to shop for shoes because I have very wide feet, so I usually don’t bother. These shoes have very wide sizes though, which was a pleasant surprise. They fit very secure on the ankles but not to tight on my wide feet, which makes them great for running. Would high recommend these shoe to anyone especially if you have wide feet and are lookin for a great slide on running shoe."
Adidas,2024-02-20,"These shoes are tight at the ankle, near the front of the hole at the top of the shoe. I ordered wide shoes, but don't know if I received a wide pair, since while I found the size on the shoe, there was nothing indicating it was a wide shoe. I bought them on clearance, so I am wearing them and hoping they stretch out and become more comfortable. That's the risk you take buying online instead of going to a shoe store."
Adidas,2023-06-05,"I bought two pairs. At first they were convenient and looked great for work. After 3 months or so of wearing them, they started to break down. Arch support was so bad I started having foot pain in my left foot. I'm giving them to charity as soon as I find replacements with better arch support. Great style but they'll ruin your feet."
Adidas,2023-06-06,"I've had 3 pairs of these, and I am sure I will have another pair. They are the best slip-on athletic shoe I've found.I use them for walking and weekend use. Super comfortable, although I did change the insole to something that fits my foot better. The only downside I've encountered is that the soles seem to wear out too quickly."
Adidas,2023-10-27,"My husband bought a pair of these and just loves them. He wears them a lot. So, I bought him a 2nd pair of the same ones for when the other ones wear out. He says they are very comfortable. They do look nice for going out. Dressier than a regular sneaker."
Adidas,2024-03-04,"Bought these for my boyfriend a couple weeks ago. He loves this style shoe - he wore out the first pair over a few years and had to have the same ones! He wears them for everything - casual day to day, at the gym, even Colorado hiking. He says they're comfortable and durable."
Adidas,2024-03-05,Soo happy with these sneakers! They were are great find at a great price!Super lightweight and extremely comfortable! l am lucky enough to be able to wear sneakers for work and these are in my lineup now! They are easy to slide on and off and the color combination gets noticed all the time!
Adidas,2023-05-19,This is the second pair of these shoes that I have purchased for my son. He absolutely loves these comfortable slip on men's sneakers! We got a second pair so that we could have them when the first pair wears out. He loves them that much! ...A man with a back-up plan!
Adidas,2024-02-06,"These feel great once you get them on. I really had to force them on. They're comfortable, but not as comfortable as my Pumas. They have that unique Adidas design that is very attractive but and I love the look. I suppose they'll get easier to slip on over time."
Adidas,2023-09-01,"These def run big. I’m a women’s 6 and landed on a men’s 4.5 after trying a couple sizes. I have a pretty narrow foot and the width of these is great for me. They have pretty good arch support too-much better than the Stan Smiths. I’ve been wanting these for a while and while they’re very cute in person, I’m slightly disappointed in the quality. The tongue is plastic and there are a couple of pieces of leather overlay that are cut sloppily. You can’t tell when they’re on so it’s not a huge deal, just annoying. Overall would repurchase."
Adidas,2024-01-31,I’ve been eyeing these for a long while and I finally purchased a pair! These shoes are so stylish and can make a casual outfit look 10x better. Be aware these shoes do have an arch inside but can be removed if you want to take the risk but overall extremely comfortable when the arch was taken out for me! I plan on buying other colors!
Adidas,2023-05-28,Fantastic sneaker. Can easily be dressed up for the office with selvage jeans or chinos. More cushioned (and comfortable) than Adidas' popular Sambas sneakers. This is a great alternative to the leather dress sneakers that are now becoming run of the mill. I recommend these!
Adidas,2023-11-02,"Finally decided to spend the money and get my son a more “quality” pair of shoes for school. $107 for these, and the sole started peeling, and there was a gaping hole through the bottom in less than 2 months. Not sure how this is possible, since my 10 year old just wears them to school everyday. Disappointed!!"
Adidas,2024-03-06,All y'all suckers paying more just for different colors for the same shoe. Well I want some black Adidas Soo I only buy whatever colors are on sale and then use fabric markers at home. I get a one of a kind unique adidas shoes for half the price of a regular black shoe...
Adidas,2023-10-24,"Awesome classic sneakers from adidas that I have always wanted but never pulled the trigger till now and glad I did! Very comfortable and easy to wear with just about everything in your closet. Highly recommend, already looking at other colors.🙂"
Adidas,2023-11-28,I'd been shoe shopping for a few days and finally found a pair I liked at a great price at Dick's. I have always had great luck finding the right product and a good price. The shoes have been extremely comfortable.
Adidas,2023-12-26,Bought these as a Christmas gift. Love the colors matches with everything so well. At first the shoe tongue was stiff and squeaked when I walked. The noise and stiffness was gone by the end of the week.
Adidas,2024-04-10,So happy with the Gazelles! They are stylish and really comfortable. Buying another pair.
Adidas,2017-08-28,"My husband had a pair of classic Adidas Gazelle when he was a teenagers and now our kids think they are ""cool."" When his birthday came around this year, the boys said we should get dad a pair of Gazelles. We went to three different stores and could not find the color and size we needed. We stopped in Nordstrom to look at shirts and sure enough the Gazelles were there... just not the size. Within minutes the shoes were ordered, free shipping, and we had them on our door step three days later. Correct size, colors, and a big smile on my husband's face! The shoes are just what he remembered from his long gone teenage years."

Adidas,2024-04-06,"There's no denying the iconic status of the adidas Originals Superstar trainers. These shoes are true classics, and they definitely live up to the hype in terms of looks. The clean lines, the shell toe, the three stripes - they're all there, and they look fantastic. I've gotten compliments on them every time I've worn them out. Comfort-wise, they're not bad. The leather upper is nice quality and feels pretty good on your feet. There's also some padding in the tongue, which helps. However, I wouldn't say they're the most supportive shoes out there. My feet started to feel a bit achy after wearing them all day walking around.

Adidas,2023-08-18,"My son loves these shoes! This is his 3rd pair of this style. The are comfortable, easy to put on, and look great. Definitely recommend."
Adidas,2024-02-09,These shoes have a good color combination. They are a little tight with no way to loosen them.

Delivered within 2-3 days because of weekend. Wanted to try something new, nice alternative to stan smith/ superstar given its price. Cushioning at the back is a bit thick so it eats into your size. Hopefully will correct itself after some walking/wear"
Adidas,2024-01-06,"Hey guys. Having a little bit of a rough time lately. For those who have experienced a brutal, knock out divorce, how did you recover financially without killing yourself working 80 hours a week? I’ve been trying to get balanced out financially, and trying to do this in an honest way, but man, at this rate I’m never going to recover. Any suggestions would be much appreciated. Happy New Year everyone."
Adidas,2023-05-28,"I purchased these to replace a pair of grand champion court shoes, and they are stylish, but not as rigid, so more comfortable than the previous pair. Not made of leather, so not 5 stars. More for casual wear rather than use as a court shoe, but will do for the price. Purchased a mens because they seemed a bit wider than the womens. Will be playing on the court with them."
Adidas,2024-03-11,"I am satisifed with the product, though they are half a size larger to my liking, as these were on clearance so the options was not available. Product is as expected, comfortable for running day to day activities. The full outer leather makes these easily cleaned, the round toe gives an informal smart casual look. Adidas give me the comfort of a trustworthy quality assurance for the product I purchased."
Adidas,2024-01-07,"Bought as a Christmas gift for fiancé as he mentioned all his trainers were letting in water. Time for a new pair! Chose these as he likes a white trainer and his favourite colour is green and they had a really good offer on in the sale. Trainers are lovely - very stylish, comfy, durable and… they don’t let the water in!"
Adidas,2023-12-07,I have worn Adidas for as long as I can remember. For a while I had a problem with my heal and only could wear running shoes with good dampening. Then I bought a pair of the cloud foam series and they are almost as comfortable as a pair of running shoes. These are not quite that comfortable but still good. The only problem is that they fit a size to small (to short mostly in my case).
Adidas,2023-12-02,My husband loves these shoes. Said they are extremely comfortable and have significantly more support than the new Balance and Nikes. He tried. He’s gotten lots of compliments on the style. The tan soles and leather uppers make them easy to keep clean
Adidas,2023-11-28,Suitability:SuperbAppearance:Same as advertisedQuality:Legit and goodVery nice buy from this store. Bought this for only 2996 pesos because of the vouchers.Sizing is very accurate.Will surely buy again.
Adidas,2023-06-11,I bought these for my boyfriend and he loves them. Very well cushioned and comfortable right out of the box. He was hesitant at first but believes he can walk long distances in them without any problem. He usually wears a size 9 but 8.5 in Adidas shoes- these shoes in size 9 are perfect for him.
Adidas,2023-12-03,Suitability:Adidas runs a little bit bigger on their sizeQuality:Adidas QualityAppearance:Superb!I saw the exact shoes at a mall and since they don’t have any shoes my size I didn’t bought it. Luckily I found it here and got it for more than 35% OFF. Thank you for the Bigating Voucher.
Adidas,2024-03-25,"I’ve always loved Adidas basketball shoes, so I was optimistic about buying these shoes. I most definitely was not let down. Not only are they great looking shoes that I can eat with shorts or business casual outfits; but they are also very comfortable! I highly recommend them."
Adidas,2024-03-26,"I bought this pair a couple weeks ago, and they are super comfy. I typically buy thick platform sneakers, so I was surprised at how much I liked these. The material makes it easy to wipe off immediate stains, so I can prolong their quality. Great purchase!"
Adidas,2024-03-18,"Like the colour, its a lot easier to keep clean, and the texture is easy to wipe.Change from the stark white.Comfy casual sneaker used for leisure. Love the wide toe box. and the reinforcing front band.Very chuffed with our purchase."
Adidas,2024-02-26,"Was looking for a white, wipeable pair of tennis shoes for summer & found these! More comfortable than the N***S. Sadly, made of synthetic material, not leather, but better than canvas. See how long they last."
Adidas,2023-07-26,The color is this dark gray and they fit true to size.Pretty comfortable for walking and standing. The best part is you can wear them on rainy days and not have to worry about the socks getting wet.Five stars
Adidas,2023-07-06,Another great look from Adidas. These can go super casual and also look good with a button down shirt. The brown accent is a nice touch to the look but is still subtle. Comfortable right out of the box.

Adidas,2023-10-22,My son likes these nice looking shoes. They are comfortable and fashionable. They run a bit small so we sized up.
Adidas,2023-11-17,"I’m going to be honest and tell you that these may be the most uncomfortable shoes I’ve ever bought. I wear a size 9, but after reading the reviews, I decided to go for a 1/2 size bigger, which was a mistake. When I first wore them, right away, there was space between my toes and the outsole (tip). Should’ve probably gotten my size. Second, maybe because of the way they are made, the back of my heel was scraped by the shoes and caused a bit of my skin to peel off, causing minimal bleeding (which ruined my white socks). But, this was all 2-3 weeks ago. Even with all the above, I still wore them and I guess I “broke them in” or got my feet used to it and they don’t bother me as much, but still wouldn’t recommend these shoes.

Adidas,2024-03-14,"We all need a pair of comfortable multipurpose casual sneakers and I’m glad Adidas Samba OG sneakers have made a successful return and are back in style. I chose the color Night Navy/Cream White/Gum. This is such a flattering shade of blue, with grey undertone. Branded stripes on the sides are slightly off-white and it goes so well with blue. My foot is 27cm long and size M9.5/W10.5 fits me perfectly with a bit room for chunky socks. The insoles are flat, so if you need extra cushion or arch support - consider sizing up half size so extra insoles won’t make them fit too snug. Overall I love this sneakers, especially considering quality and comfort to price ratio."
Adidas,2024-03-13,"I love Nordstrom. Pretty much the only place I shop for fashion on-line. Today, my much anticipated Adidas Sambas arrived. I have been trying to buy these for a year but they never have my size in stock, but one day while looking, again, they had ONE - 7.5 women's black Sambas available. In my cart, $100 bucks, bam! Today I am sad, they came in a crushed, taped back together box, no shape insert, laced-up, clearly worn with animal or something hair inside both, and schmutz on the soles. They look like I could have gotten them at Goodwill. Not a consignment store, because they would have at least cleaned them up before selling them. :-("
Adidas,2024-02-13,"I normally wear women’s 9 and got these in 9.5 (marked on inside US 8.5, uk 8, fr42, jp 265) I got them in 9.5 because 9 was sold out. Anyway i wore them on a trip everyday for 14 days. Wore them with cotton no-show socks. They were very comfortable. No break in and no blisters. I noticed that the shoe has a very narrow toe box so even though 9 would have been better length wise, it may have squeezed my toes so the mainly walking trip may have been a more uncomfortable on my feet. I did A LOT walking in warm weather. I have other adidas in woman’s 9 (marked on the inside us 8, uk 7.5, fr 41.5, jp 260). So go figure. The sizing maybe is weird because this shoe is so narrow."
Adidas,2024-04-06,What seemed like a great price with 10% discount (€101) wasn’t! I got stung for €32 extra import charges. I was extremely surprised that such a large company like Office didn’t cover these charges. They also don’t make this obvious or clear! I order from many UK sites such as Atom Retro and they cover all charges. The fact I was able to change the price from £ to € led me to believe there wouldn’t be any import charges. Perhaps putting a clear message at checkout would be beneficial for people buying from Ireland. This also added extra time for the delivery to arrive! The Samba OG’s are great though!
Adidas,2023-11-06,"I've been researching Samba OG sneakers for a minute and everywhere I've read, I was told to size up. I am normally a woman's size 10 (I am a true 10 with wide feet). In Converse, I wear (men's) size 7.5 or 8s. But for Samba OG sneakers, I ordered a woman's 10.5/men's 9.5. I just came on here to exchange for a smaller size but they're completely out of the white/halo blue/gum5 color way -- as is nearly every other store it seems -- so I'm sticking with these even though my feet look disproportionately larger than the rest of my body. Whoops! I think it is safe to play it conservative, at least in the way sizing is listed on Nordstrom's site, and go for your regular size."
Adidas,2023-07-01,I love my new Sambas! I have a pair that is in good condition except the sole has come apart on one of them. I’m planning on trying to fix them but I saw ASOS had them in stock so I jumped on a new pair. They are comfortable and stylish! I’m happy with my purchase. I’m going to purchase the white pair next. You can wear them with anything. I wore a black A lined dress with them yesterday. You definitely should have a pair of these in your collection if you’re fashionable and want a good pair of athletic shoes.

In addition to their comfort, the Adidas shoes are incredibly versatile. They are suitable for multiple purposes, including casual wear, sport activities, or running errands. My husband has worn both pairs, to the gym, to work, and even to social events, and they always look great. I must confess that I enjoy seeing him wear these shoes as much as he enjoy wearing them. They are both comfortable and stylish, and they complement his wardrobe perfectly.

Adidas,2024-02-27,"I've had 8 pairs of these shoes and they still don't disappoint. I'm usually a size 10-10.5, but I'm a solid 9.5 women's in this style of shoe. They are soft on the top of the foot and cushioned heel. They are not meant for side stepping sports or running as they do not provide stability. It's a very good shoe for gym training, which I use it for. It can also be used for walking. It does take a bit to break in as it does not lace up. It's a push through the shoe approach. The shoe will stretch over time. They are washable in the machine and last a long time. I love them. I'll pay full price for them. You will not be disappointed with the shoe. I got the pale camo grey and love it!!!"
Adidas,2023-12-26,"Mainly bought this product for casual wear. I bought my usual size and the fit and feel is very comfortable. The upper is soft and I don't even notice these on my feet. I have multiple pairs of this style shoe. These particularly are very comfortable and would recommend for any casual wearing purposes. There are some glue imperfections around the upper and the sole of the shoe. But unless you're really trying to look for it, it's not very noticeable. Overall very happy with the shoes."
Adidas,2023-12-03,"My son loves these. He prefers them over his Air Max. I originally noticed them because they were on sale for a great deal, but based on my son's review I would pay regular price. He says they are so comfortable. They're light as a feather. And, they shipped VERY quickly. How they hold up remains to be seen, but based on how much my son likes them, I would order them again."
Adidas,2023-09-11,"I'm used to ultraboost so maybe in terms of comfort, I'm a little spoiled but I wanted to try a new shoe and saw this one. I thought it looked pretty sleek and fit my style but when I got the shoe I realized the tongue is fixed and doesn't move. I have some pretty wide feet so I half-sized up but it was so cramped and the soles felt like bricks. It's a good looking shoe but would not recommend it for everyday walking/comfort shoes."
Adidas,2023-01-15,"Wifee and I needed another pair of all black Adidas. So I found these and ordered them. My wife wore hers first and the FIRST thing she said was....OMG HONEY THESE ARE MORE COMFORTABLE THAN THE ONES WE BOUGHT 2YRS AGO. She was highly impressed with these. So after I wore mine...I agreed with her 1000%!!!! So, right after that we went to the outlet and bought outfits to go with our shoes. The price was perfect, EXTREMELY comfortable and light. Perfect pair I must say!"
Adidas,2024-03-17,Bought these for my boyfriend who recently discovered he's been wearing the wrong size shoes. I don't think he's worn anything else since getting these. He stated they are incredibly comfortable and loves the stretchy fabric on top. They look incredible with jeans or gym clothes. Would def buy again!
Adidas,2023-11-25,Shoes are very stylish and nice however Adidas really didn't think through the functional design of the shoe... the heel tab is too high and rubs against your skin causing blisters. The shoes are also fairly narrow. Definitely a painful first wear so be careful! Hope it gets better as it is broken in
Adidas,2020-08-28,"To be honest, these are the most uncomfortable pair of shoes i have ever owned. Im pretty much a size 11 in every shoe and for some reason these are pretty tight all around. I was also not a fan of the tongue on these either, its not adjustable if that makes sense. I had bought these on sale since they were advertised as a ""running shoe"".

If anyone is ... MoreTo be honest, these are the most uncomfortable pair of shoes i have ever owned. Im pretty much a size 11 in every shoe and for some reason these are pretty tight all around. I was also not a fan of the tongue on these either, its not adjustable if that makes sense. I had bought these on sale since they were advertised as a ""running shoe"".

Adidas,2024-03-20,"I wanted these shoes to replace my worn out Adidas shoes that looked very similar to these (bought last year) and that I loved. I bought my usual size 9 and it was much too big all over, especially in the length above my toe, where I could press down my thumb completely on the shoe and not touch my toe at all. I put the shoe next to my previous pair and it was in fact noticeably much longer. Both were a size 9. I ordered the 8 1/2.and it fits perfectly. I’ve already worn it to an exercise class and it seems very supportive and comfortable."
Adidas,2024-03-18,"The shoes are a nice enough style. I find it increasingly difficult to find training shoes in a sea of running or walking shoes. However the is no cushion in the sole. It's very flat and hard inside. I like that the back of the shoe comes up high on the back of tie ankle. However, the that stiffness makes it difficult to step into the shoe."
Adidas,2024-03-22,"I was a bit nervous about buying these as I know what a nightmare it can be to get it wrong!I took a chance and ordered them and they're great. They have a nice bounce in them that is great when running but also the bottom of the shoe feels really sturdy so when I do squats my feet feel really stable.Really good shoes, would definitely recommend!"
Adidas,2024-03-11,"They are extremely stylish and turn heads at the gym. I've worn them a few times and find them to be comfortable but also heavy. I thought they would have been a bit more low profile since they are ""training"" shoes. None the less, I will keep them and continue to enjoy the compliments from on lookers."
Adidas,2024-04-05,I was out of town and needed a sneaker right away and picked these in orange and white. They are so comfortable and I love the space around the toes! They run a little big so size down a 1/2 size. Sharp looking shoe! Will purchase again!
Adidas,2024-03-01,I ordered 10M. It ran very big. This shoe would be great for a wide foot or someone with bunions or other foot issues it’s also more of a pink than red trim. Not what I expected so unfortunately I had to return.
Adidas,2024-01-11,Sassy looking fittness shoe. Very comfortable. I have feet that constantly hurt. I am very active and find this perfect.
Adidas,2024-03-30,"Very comfortableRuns a bit largeUsually 9.5-10, but 9 fits greatLots of toe room but still holds foot in place for cardio and hit training"
Adidas,2024-02-26,These trainers fit my wide feet well and feel supportive and comfortable for my daily activities. Ordered normal size.
Adidas,2024-01-19,"Really sharp looking. Just a touch of red for style. I belong to three gyms, so I need lots of fittness shoes"
Nike,2024-03-11,"I just bought these last week and wore them for the first time today. ~5 hours of walking and standing with no complaints at all. I am very impressed. Very comfortable, no break-in period, excellent for people with wide feet. Awesome daily sneaker, only con is they're a good bit heavier than the shoes I typically wear daily (Hoka Bondi, New Balance 1080, Brooks Ghost). For reference, I'm a size 14 and wear a 2E in all my athletic shoes. Didn't need a wide option for these."
Nike,2023-10-15,"The shows feels good as soon as you put it on. My normal got it is the AF1, but wanted some everyday kicks that I didn’t have to match - classic colors that go with everything. These are the combo of what Nike does best - lighter than AF1, but roomy on the inside. Sole is like a dunk or Jordan 1. Super comfortable. Hope they continue with these."
Nike,2024-03-12,Super stoked with this purchase!!! These look super sick!!! The leather on these is amazing quality!! Sometime nikes has some thin leather and crease easy. These don't!! Definitely made well. Shipping was crazy fast 2. Ordered 2 days ago and already showed up on my door step.
Nike,2024-03-17,"Normally I don’t write reviews but this shoe is too good to not let others know! If you want an AF1 + Jordan’s feel to a shoe that is a bit cheaper this is the shoe to buy! I would size up half a size (or a full size; it depends) if you don’t want a snug fit or tend to wear thicker socks, otherwise this unisex shoe is great 10/10!"
Nike,2024-01-09,I bought these shoes for Christmas for my 12 year old son and he absolutely loved them. He doesn’t usually follow the trend he likes to look different from what everyone else wears like the “Pandas”. This shoe is great comfortable and stylish shoe. I’m happy and he’s happy.
Nike,2023-11-22,The photos definitely don’t do them justice but these shoes are absolutely beautiful in person and up close with them. They can be so universally styled with many different outfits. This is a great show for anyone who is into shoes like dunks or air forces but wants to expand they’re horizons.
Nike,2024-03-24,My grandson (13) loves these Nike shoes. Loves the style to wear with his jogger pants. Size 12. Fits perfect. He ordered the pair with the orange basketball on the tung as he's into basketball. Nice shoe.
Nike,2023-10-24,Got a pair of Nikes after being denied on the SNKRS app for years. Nice shoe for the price. Sole is super comfy feels like a dunk with more cushion. Roomy in the toes. Only issue is the sides slightly rub my ankle.
Nike,2023-10-19,Really good show! Just bought it recently thinking it would fit like an Air Force (where you have to size down). Not in this case! The shoe fit true to size!Affordable shoe!
Nike,2024-03-06,"Bought these for my son. He loves the look and says they were comfortable. He usually can't wear Nike sneakers because he has wide feet, but these don't bother him. Got them on sale which was a bonus."
Nike,2024-01-18,Liked the shoe overall and decided to buy from StockX as they had a better price. After fees it came to $147 which is still great. After receiving the shoe I put it on the legit check app and it came back authentic so overall really happy buying from StockX.
Nike,2023-05-16,"Awesome sneaker!! Great condition and all the style might not be for everyone, but good service overall i would recommend, but the shipping needs some work, price to steep to take that long to arrive from stockx"
Nike,2023-04-17,Very unique and interesting design. The shoe should be way more popular and valuable than it is. Definitely an overlooked shoe.
Nike,2023-10-07,Love the shoe and its very nice quality except for the fact the spikes on the bottom fall off after a few uses. Only complaint was that this took a couple weeks to ship.
Nike,2024-01-15,"Feels good on the feet , spikes on the bottom makes you feel like you’re standing on something squishy on hard floors, but over time I know they will where off and feel like a regular Air Force One , but I like them ."
Nike,2023-04-21,Very good product. Came brand new and was in perfect condition. I love these!
Nike,2022-12-15,I think they are a very unique dope looking shoe comfortable and for being Off-Whites they are relatively cheap in price and feel like they are durable and would last a long time
Nike,2023-05-09,"they are very comfortable and convenient, only because they are made in China and I don't know if they are original"
Nike,2023-03-27,The shoe came looking like it was tried on. I have no clue why it came with creases on the back as if someone out it on without a shoe horn.
Nike,2024-02-13,"After a long time, I finally own a proper pair of shoes… Finally! <3"
Nike,2023-05-07,I purchased a brand new pair of sb dunks and received a used pair of scuffed up dunks!! I Contacted stock x and told them about thr problem and they refused to exchange them for a new pair and refused to give me a refund!!! How did they ever pass the verification process??? I will never buy from stock x again....poor service!!!
Nike,2024-03-07,"BADASS SHOES. If you bought them for a 12 year old boy, buy new socks too. LOL. Grey no show socks look best to me but see thru areas on shoes so don't let them wear them with those brand new white socks they wore on the trampoline last week....."
Nike,2023-03-06,Product came with defects on clear part of shoe. Looks like they've been worn once. The fact you allowed it to pass is insane. Think ill be taking my business elsewhere next time
Nike,2023-03-05,I always buy what catches my eye. The design is something you might dream up but never see made up. Nice to see Nike still willing to experiment and support designers with unique vision!
Nike,2024-03-01,It looked better in the pictures used for advertisement than in person. I wasn’t impressed with it when I got it.It looked ok.Not worth the price.
Nike,2023-04-19,"All it was in perfect condition , I bought them to wear them so you have to wear fat shock because you feel the corners"
Nike,2023-03-03,Heres what happen i like the shoe was just checkin on my phone to see how much shipped so i was at the check out screen im like ok not bad went and put my phone in my pocket and purchased by mistake tried to cancel it like 30 secs later and it wouldnt let me plz fix that
Nike,2023-04-04,Great shoe. I love the colors and the see thru part just give u a chance to show off your colorful socks.
Nike,2023-12-19,Very nice shoes. I like the look of it because it‘s something never seen.
Nike,2023-04-01,Cool shoes and definitely a head turner! They’re comfortable and very sheik!
Nike,2024-02-14,"The Nike kill shot 2 sneaks are so fresh! Unique and tiny retro vibes! These shoes are so comfortable! They are not wide foot friendly but that doesn’t bother me. The gummy soles provide excellent traction. I’ve only had mine for a few months and they look like they came straight out the box still!! The do only have minor support, defiantly more of fashion statement than a workout shoe. I will forever have a pair of these in my closet!"
Nike,2023-07-03,"I never write reviews and buy at least 15 pairs of nikes per year. These may be the best shoe they have ever made. I just wish they came back out with the green ones. When they made this pair 6 years ago, it was a collab with j crew, and they only went up to size 12. I begged and I hope other people did too, and they finally caved in summer of 2018. They fit perfect, are versatile, look great on every foot, and all stylish. Great contrast and can wear with anything…..also BRING BACK THE LUCID GREEN!"
Nike,2022-05-18,"These shoes have a ton of flexibility. Can be dressed up or down. A solid, classic, yet modern vibe that can help you stand out from the crowd. Good quality construction with the gum yellow and textured leathers. Literally an everyday shoe. Ordered the desert orange....haven't seen another pair on anyone. I've probably been asked about them 50+ times.I would order 3 more pairs if they had them in stock. Dreaming of a maroon colorway to drop."
Nike,2019-11-18,"Nice, light-weight shoe with a modern look that exudes style. It is made with quality materials; though, the leather is a little on the shiny side, it is still a decent quality leather. These are not spongy in feel; rather, you feel a little lower to the ground, but still feeling comfortable with a good amount of cushioning. These are good for all-day wear with no foot fatigue that I can tell.They did crease in the toe area, just in front of the suede trim after the first day of wear, but nothing that would be a deal-breaker. The color has different hues of off white. Though subjective, I like the contrasting rubber sole and lower trim.All in all, I really like these shoes for a casual, comfortable look."
Nike,2024-04-05,They're awesome! The leather feels super high-quality and they've gotten more comfortable the more I wear them. They look great with pretty much everything and the grip is solid too. Totally recommend if you're into sneakers that are both stylish and comfy!
Nike,2021-03-31,"I am a nike fan through and through. From Cortez to Pegasus, almost all my non-dress shoes are nike, so i really do not like writing a negative review First off, these were a half-size too big in length. at that half-size too big, they were very narrow. I wear a 9.5 in the Nike Free RN, Nike Pegasus, and Nike Cortez. So, I ordered a 9.5. they were slightly narrow on the width, and at least a half size too long. Not to mention the overall cushion seems to be lacking. All this in mind I am returning them. I would try to get them in another size, but they are no longer available.... i made this purchase with two other items, and another item was not available after ordering... so i got one of three items i ordered to work... thanks for socks.."
Nike,2023-03-02,"Don’t ever stop making these shoes. I’ve bought many pairs in all different colors, and I’ll keep buying more as long as they’re sold. They’re such classic shoes with a streamlined and modern look, and they’re super comfortable. My only complaint is that I wear them so much I have beat each pair up pretty badly. Wish I could keep a pair fresh. If you’re even considering, don’t think just get ‘em."
Nike,2023-11-16,"I live in a place that rains a lot, has red dirt, and I ride a bike to and from work every day. These Killshots are my go to shoe for a when I want something white and clean in this environment. They are easy to clean and look great. StockX delivered them quickly and in good condition."
Nike,2024-02-26,The Nike Killshot 2 has a vintage style that looks great with shorts or jeans. The upper leather is of good quality and the suede toe and heal along with the gum some make for nice a contrast. They are comfortable but don’t offer a lot of arch support so I wear my own insoles.
Nike,2023-11-06,"I love the Nike Killshot 2’s! An absolute classic that has remained simple, understated and versatile! I can wear these to work or lounging around and they suit either purpose just fine. I wear a size 10 in Nike and they fit perfect."
Nike,2023-07-08,"Love Hibbett. Early release, this specific shoe hasn't really released anywhere else in the u.s that I know of so I was glad to get my hands on these . Never have any issues. Shipping consistent always. Nice colorway on a classic shoe. True to size. Shoe boxes flawless. Shoes are flawless. I'm happy"
Nike,2023-12-11,"I am a huge fan of differing styles of dunks. I have to remind people that pandas are not the only color way. I got these on sale and amberwood swoosh pops. Great shoe for a great price from a great company.These are not all day shoes, but comfortable to wear out in style and comfort. What are you waiting for? Go cop a pair!!"
Nike,2024-03-31,"Dunks to me aren’t comfortable shoes. I scrolled passed these shoes so many times on this app, but I saw these in person in a store and I couldn’t pass them up. They look so much better in person. And once I tried them on, I knew I had to get them. The upper is so soft that it makes these Dunks way more comfortable."
Nike,2024-03-08,"I got my pair . These shoes are stunning! They almost look like an SB in hand. The suede waffle detail is unique, Like I said recently Nike has changed the cushioning on some dunks IMHO they're really really comfortable. These are well crafted kicks. They really do look yummy. I highly recommend these."
Nike,2023-09-07,"These Oil Green Nike Dunks are great and stylish. They look great on-foot and the appearance is as expected with any dunk. Only minor things I would note is QC. Some parts of the leather were not cut properly and there a some glue marks on the shoe. Overall, not a bad colorway and would recommend for a fall or spring themed outfit."
Nike,2023-09-12,"I will always speak highly of the black/white (panda) dunks. Not only are they cool and comfortable, but they're clean and classic, and easily replaced the OG AF1 as your everyday shoe. They're so crispy and literally look good with anything. And just like the AF1 in it's prime, copping a fresh pair is addicting!"
Nike,2023-12-10,Arrived on time to be a nice Christmas present for our 13 yr old grandson. These Nike Dunk Low Retro was on tthe top of his Christmas wish list. A couple of his friends wears these shoes and they hold up very well and they are nice looking shoes. He does not have a clue he is getting them. Excited to see him open them on Christmas.
Nike,2023-11-23,"Love these Dunks. They are pretty comfortable but can become uncomfortable if your standing for more then about an hour but that's about every show. Pretty good quality, the sewing can become slightly undone which takes away from the look but from a distance it's unnoticed. Overall like a shoes a lot and would recommend them if you can find them on sale."
Nike,2023-12-18,The color is more beautiful in hand! They fit perfectly! I bought these for myself for Christmas and I’m in love! Been feeling the neutral colors especially the green color this season because I been feeling more grounded and these dunks just proves that I’m standing on business lol.
Nike,2023-09-10,Such an awesome shoe! This was a purchase for my 12 year old nephew! It’s tough finding a shoe that’s right for him! However this kid loves the shoe! Color goes with everything & very durable! Not to mention he wont be able to get them dirty due to the black color & leather!
Nike,2024-01-01,"The Waffle Debut is a great looking casual shoe if you are looking for that old school look with modern tech. The fit of the shoe is very true to size but runs a little narrow. I wouldn't recommend increasing in size due to this, just recognize if you have a bit wider of a foot, you may be uncomfortable in this. I have a pretty standard width foot and I felt that my toes were a bit scrunched together. To me, the design of the shoe is perfect.

The suede toe can take quite a beating and the mesh on the sides seems to stay pretty clean when exposed to dirt. The best aspect of this shoe is definitely its comfort level. The foam sole feels very resilient and is great if you have a short commute to the office or if you are out walking around. While it is comfortable as a casual shoe, that is the farthest I would recommend for wearing this shoe in regards to activity. It most definitely is not meant for any form of exercise. The only aspect I would change with this show is attaching the tongue to the upper of the shoe a bit more on the sides. It tends to roll down to the outside of my foot as I walk, which is standard with a lot of shoes and my foot shape I think, but it would be nice to see it attached a bit better to prevent rolling. Less"
Nike,2023-12-26,"The Nike Waffle Debut does not have a flashy design. It's very simple yet still stylish for an everyday wear. I must say it has exceeded my expectations on comfort. From the moment I slipped them on, the comfort was immediately noticeable. The shoe's cushioning is just right—providing a supportive yet plush feel that makes every step a pleasure. This is rare for me since my my foot is wide and flat.The classic waffle sole delivers fantastic traction.

The nike swoosh and the heel tab (or pull) would have been a better design had it been one piece of leather material instead of the heel part overlapping on the swoosh. It would have made the design a tad cleaner.Overall, the Nike Waffle Debut is a great overall shoe from workout sessions to casual outings, which makes it great for anyone with an active lifestyle. Less"
Nike,2023-12-26,"I think these shoes are really great overall. I like the design and the nike waffle inspiration, as I think the waffle is a great starting silhouette. I think the tread is perfect, going back to that waffle inspiration, as it not only provides great tread but also the tread that looks wraps up the front looks really good. I think my favorite part of the shoes are the easily the materials used. I really love the soft suede that is used all along the upper, as I think not only is it really comfortable, but the looks is absolutely perfect for the style and shape of the shoe. With that, the mesh in other areas for breathability is really helpful, and also adds to the ""sporty casual"" look to the shoes that make it so you can wear them with almost any outfit all the time. ... MoreI think these shoes are really great overall.

Nike,2023-12-23,Ive worn this pair of sneakers a handful of times now since i’ve owned them. They go really well with a pair of jeans and a nice tee-shirt or polo. They are not too dressy but are stylish enough to be worn to a decent restaurant on a date. The colors are pretty neutral and can match with a ton of things.The materials on the sneakers were nothing amazing but definitely get the job done. My favorite part about this sneaker is the grip on the bottom. It is uniquely setup in an almost beehive like pattern that really feels good while wearing. The grip is great and they are very comfortable to wear. I think the design is pretty cool. They do not stand out too much but the mixture of fabric and textures does give the sneaker a nice look.

Nike,2024-01-08,These shoes were very comfortable from when I had first put them on. They have a thicker looking feel to them. They definitely go more with shorts and sweats when going out.

Nike,2023-12-24,"These shoes are very comfortable and fits true to size. I would suggest you order the shoe size the way you buy your Nike sneakers.The design is very minimalist since it is monochrome. The Nike shoes design stands out so I get compliments all the time! I love the outer sole waffle design.In terms of the material, the suede is very high quality. The combination of suede and nylon reminds of the classic Nike Cortez.I love the color blocking, you can never go wrong with the Black/White colorway. They can be paired with any type of jeans.If there is something that I would like to change, it would be the nylon toe box, it creases and wrinkles easily. It would be good if the toe box was suede also.Overall, I love these shoes. They are easy to pair with my outfit."
Nike,2023-12-29,"Wow. These are great. You get a hit of the retro/nostalgia factor because of the famous waffle sole. It's also a twist on the Nike Waffle One, which is another sneaker I love. This Waffle Debut feels more supportive, however. I think it's the suede and nylon uppers that make it feel more snug, in a good way. The suede and the nylon uppers, along with the exposed tongue, definitely add to the retro/nostalgia vibe. I got the black and white pair and they go with EVERYTHING. I'm thinking of picking up the grey fog/light smoke pair too. They're so easy to just slap on and go run errands, take a quick walk around the block, and they even hold up well if you need to hit the town for date night."
Nike,2023-12-26,"These sneakers are your go-to choice for busy mornings when you need stylish and comfortable shoes to carry you through the day. They're cool enough to turn heads without screaming for attention, and the classic Waffle bottoms are a throwback to Nike's iconic trainer, something I always appreciate.Unfortunately, these beauties weren't the perfect fit for my slightly wide feet. They felt a tad too narrow, like a straight jacket for my toes. Although the black colorway is versatile and matches everything, for everyday wear, I crave something that lets my feet breathe. As much as I love the history behind the Waffle bottoms, comfort ultimately wins out."
Nike,2023-12-26,"So I gave these shoes a go and boy do I love em, they are very lightweight and comfortable and are perfect for any occasion whether it's everyday wear or even the gym. I've been wearing them a lot just doing some normal holiday errands and it makes the busy day at least bearable in these super comfy shoes. The material is lightweight and breathable and feels like your hardly wearing anything at all but that doesn't come at the cost of comfort. The sole is very soft and feels like your walking on foam which is nice. They also fit snug around my foot which for lightweight shoes is usually a challenge as I have a long slender foot. Overall love these shoes and their price point is not bad at all."
Nike,2024-03-08,"Disappointed to receive these. The silver/platinum shown is photos is actually white in person. Clearly the laces look to be silver so I was thinking this sneaker would show more platinum and that's not the case at all. Let my actual photo do the ""talking"". It's a basic black & white Vomero5 with some grey details. I was going to gift this to my husband but I'll return em. These shoes are comfortable but I was definitely hoping to get what was shown in pic."
Nike,2024-04-05,I bought these for work. On my feet all day. Back and forth back and forth. Probably the most comfortable shoe ive had and i buy alot of shoes for work. They fit very nice. They are the lightest shoe ive worn. They fit like a glove…like you are wearing a sock. Nice cushion. I love em.
Nike,2024-02-03,"As a former track athlete this shoe was nostalgic. The cushion is amazing, maybe a little bouncy for some. But definitely absorbed impact and helped with jump practice. As a casual show just feels like walking on comfortable springs and giving you a bounce in each step. I say got true to size for this shoe."
Nike,2023-03-14,I had been looking for an NB 2002R for over a year and am glad I got these instead. I just could not find a colourway in the NB I liked but having tried them on a few times I was convinced they were my next pair as they were incredibly comfortable with just the right amount of technical detail. Then along came the V5 in this smoking colourway that goes with just about anything and they're equally as comfortable as the 2002R. I went up a half size as I always do with Nike but didn't need to as the toe box has plenty of room for a normal or slighter wider foot. Order your regular size...from size?
Nike,2023-09-28,"Been seeing a lot of these on feet as well as my friends always talking about getting these. And I figured why not try it out, and wow do these shoes not disappoint. Love how comfy they are and they go with a lot of my outfits. Definitely recommend getting these as an everyday pair"
Nike,2023-10-16,Color in the picture doesnt totally match the actual color of the shoe. StockX should do a better job matching them together so the consumer knows what they're buying. Overall I'm decently impressed but the shoe is way more white than I was anticipating.
Nike,2019-06-25,"I got both the white and black pairs on sale and great first impressions. No break-in time after walking 3 miles straight out the box. The combination of zoom air and cushlon provide plenty of cushioning without sacrificing stability. They are lighter they look, but feel durable enough to take a beating (only time will tell). They run true to size, but have a wide toe box. I wouldn't recommend these as performance running shoes, but great for all day comfort/walking. Some may think the muted tonal colors are boring (check out the SE SP if you want colors), but the shoe's design is funky enough (love the hits of 3M on the toe and heel) that they will get you noticed without being too in your face."
Nike,2024-01-11,The service was excellent . I had my shoes with 3 days of ordering. . First the overall look and design is awesome !!The comfort is great. I can wear these all day !!
Nike,2024-02-12,This is a great shoe for running! It has great cushioning and it’s light and breathable. This design is also easy to style even with casual wear. This has become my favorite running shoe.
Nike,2023-10-16,Super comfy shoe! Kept my feet in good shape wile stomping around universal studios all weekend! Def pick up another pair. Can’t wait to see different color ways
Nike,2023-08-31,"My son loves these. I bought these because he wanted air forces, and after having two pairs of them, I decided to get him these instead. He still don't know these aren't actually air forces. They don't seem to crease as bad and he says they are more comfortable. And the price is more reasonable. These are my new go to when he asks for another pair of air forces. Shipping was quick. Product was good. There were small faint dark spots on one shoe my son noticed, but with a wipe, it came right out."
Nike,2023-12-07,"I bought these while they were on sale for my husband, and he loved them. The colors make them easy to match with almost anything! He is very flat footed and he said he thought they were going to hurt his feet but surprisingly they were very comfortable. Quality of the shoe is superb, as though they were straight from the Nike outlet. Definitely a good purchase at a cheap price! I got him his regular size shoe size and they fit perfect! These shoes look better in person than on picture. 10/10 recommend."
Nike,2023-08-03,My son really wanted these shoes. They were out of stock in store so we ordered online. School starts tomorrow so I don't have time to return them but I would if I had more time. The stitching is loose and coming apart in several places. There are several differences and imperfections between the left and right shoes. These remind me of something you'd buy in an outlet store for discount price because they have defects. I guess for the price I can't ask for too much but I expected a little better quality from Nike.
Nike,2023-10-27,This is the second pair I've purchased. The last ones have worn out on the right crease on upper material but they have literally been worn almost everyday by a teenager. Used for school and for everyday use. One has also been adapted. These have given excellent support around the ankles. This pair haven't been worn yet as one again has been sent off to be adapted but absolutely worth the money.
Nike,2023-10-23,"Size:11\n\nGreat buy. I agree with other reviews that this feels on the budget side for a Nike due to a good amount of its material are recycled. Or at least that's what Nike is advertising. If you prideful ass can look past that we'll you have an awesome pair here. It is very comfortable and light which in reality, what I really like. It's a looker. White with a black swoosh is always a staple. Clean af."
Nike,2024-01-12,"These shoes look so fire. That when I wear them I have to keep a fire extinguisher handy. They are comfortable and match 89% of my outfits. I love the color way, it's simple but yet flashy but yet subtle but yet fresh. I would recommend these kicks to any sneakerhead or non sneakerhead"
Nike,2024-02-28,"For every day casual wear. The durability and flexibility is just just bad. It's already ripping where the rubber sole meets the side of the shoe. Not even 3 months and it's failed my expectations for longevity. It's comparable to cheaper brands, this Nike shoes is a total let down."
Nike,2024-01-04,"This was a Christmas gift for my son and it was the best thing I could have gotten him. The shoes are beautiful - they look exactly like the picture showed - beautiful mix of color. He's been wearing them since the shoes came home. And, I was even happier that the shoes arrived earlier than anticipated. Thank you!!!"
Nike,2023-09-10,"I haven’t bought a pair of Nike hightops is years. I wanted a nostalgic look, and these sneakers scream that. Even though they’re technically a men’s shoe, they have a gender neutral appearance. This picture does it justice - a little worn, not quite crisp white, yet still still has a fresh feel."
Nike,2023-12-18,My husband really likes these and says they’re comfortable. We had an issue though with the top tearing when he went to wear them and I contacted customer service and they sent a replacement asap. We returned the damaged ones. Hopefully it doesn’t happen again. He bought his true to size.
Nike,2022-05-20,So it's been about a week and a half since I first got these legend essentials which I waited and anticipated and was thrilled when I got him I immediately put them on and sized up the laces to fit my foot and just like I thought snug and my foot felt secure just what I wanted a comfortable walk stand or even light jog wood be pleasant. About 3 days ago I started noticing which looks to appear to be a malfunction a rip tear or in other words a lousy manufacturing. This light problem could be the fault of the manufacturer or the person who put it together I don't hold Nike or fine line accountable since then I just haven't wore the shoe it's something about a shoe that has to look clean and just presentable when they're on my feet so the next day I went to Nike ... MoreSo it's been about a week and a half since I first got these legend essentials which I waited and anticipated and was thrilled when I got him I immediately put them on and sized up the laces to fit my foot and just like I thought snug and my foot felt secure just what I wanted a comfortable walk stand or even light jog wood be pleasant.

Nike,2021-07-11,"This shoes have absolutely no breathability. I went out to run errands once and my feet were on fire and super sweaty! I've never had a workout sneaker with this problem before. Definitely a disappointment but since I bought them mostly for inside weight training I kept them. The front is already kind of falling apart after 3 weeks, they're definitely low quality. Would do not recommend, especially if you plan to work out outside. I'll happily pay 2x to have a comfortable, more durable shoe."
Nike,2023-02-15,"I ordered a uk 8.5 and uk 6 us 8.5 arrived in a UK 8.5 box. I will obviously return however it is extremely annoying that there is no actual customer service representatives available to email or talk to about this. Obviously when these go back in to stock they will be restocked as UK 8.5 as that’s what it says on the box and these trainers will continue to be sold incorrectly, it’s seems nobody has bothered to check. Very disappointed in ASOS for this."
Nike,2021-02-23,"They're Nike and they are Legends. They live up to their name. They look great. The vibrant colours and details stand out. Comfortable and the soles are cushioned. Great quality however to me they are a little on the thin side. Breathable and more like running trainers but still weatherproof and warm. I bought a 9.5 which is usually a perfect fit for me in trainers, however these are a little bit snug I would go .5 higher than your usual size."
Nike,2021-08-02,"Every Nike product (soft material, non-leather) has torn and been left useless after very limited indoor use at the gym for weightlifting. The material has torn on 3 pairs of Tessens. One pair lasted less than 90 days. I've bought four pairs in the last two and a half years. I hope this purchase proves otherwise. I buy them for style and comfort but as a consumer I'm getting tired of throwing my money away."
Nike,2022-06-19,Really amazing price on a really sweet shoe! The white ones look extra crisp and give a squeaky clean feeling when you have them on. They arrived really fast and right on point! The size does feel like it runs a bit short but maybe it's just me. I would definitely buy these again if had the chance.
Nike,2021-05-03,"Bought as a gym training shoe for my basketball training. Really supportive and well fitting (does run slightly narrow but I have wide feet).Perfect balance of sturdiness for barbell work and comfort for movement / cardio.I also have a Metcon 4 which are brilliant for barbell work but too stiff for cardio, and a Pegasus which are great for cardio but awful for barbell work.So these are perfect. Also, they look brilliant as they have that Nike Air feel to them."
Nike,2023-06-15,"The shoes fit very well. They are comfortable on my feet. Not to loose like some other brand. Good buy for the money, if this wasn't true then I wouldn't be giving this review."
Nike,2021-03-09,I thought they were ok for appearance and comfort. I was correct. Run a Little wide but I was willing to just keep them. They are very comfortable. I wore them for the first time today walking around the track of a park. The back heel of the shoe already appears bent and I only walked. I only wear Nike sneakers. Very disappointed.
Nike,2021-04-14,"Shoes are nice and fresh. Comfortable enough, I usually wear AF1s & Jordan's but wanted a cheap lightweight shoe as I wear a foot brace - much lighter than what I usually wear which is great. They're wide enough to fit an AFO in but slightly narrow right at the toes but I have wider feet so probably wouldn't affect most people. Great colour they're like ice white."

To sloppy!They’re fine for every-day wear, but I don’t feel they offer enough support, stability, or durability for any kind of real active athletic endeavors.Pros are that they are Gore-Tex with a slight gator and pull-tabs, and they are very breathable because of the thin Gore-Tex membrane. *And they finally came out in an all Blacked-Out color-way, but the all-Black color-way was only offered on nike.com and in Nike stores, hard to obtain.Pegasus Trail 4 Gore-Tex are actually lighter than the lower profiled Pegasus 36 Gore-Tex which are ultra-lightweight, which is NOT what I want or need.

Nike,2022-10-18,"First, the good. For a trail running shoe, which can often feel overly bulky and rigid, this is about as nimble and comfortable as they come. They also look great — my boyfriend, who does not run, almost bought a pair for himself, and they’ve gotten compliments from strangers as well. But the biggest reason I upgraded from the Pegasus Trail 2s was the promise of rain-proof Gore-Tex, and these largely deliver.

That being said….The less good. Even though the shoes do a very good job of keeping water out, they do an unfortunately good job of keeping water in as well. About a mile in I started to feel moisture inside one shoe and feared that the shoes weren’t as waterproof as I had hoped. It turns out it wasn’t the outside of my socks I was feeling, but the inside. Definitionally, Gore-Tex isn’t the most breathable material, so any sweat that builds up inside will get trapped in greater amounts compared to non-coated shoes.Ultimately though, I bought these shoes for a very specific purpose: to run in wet conditions without worrying about soaking wet socks and the blisters that accompany them. And in that respect, I think these are the best waterproof trail shoes on the market right now. I’m looking forward to giving them a try in snowy conditions as well this winter. Less"
Nike,2023-05-06,"I bought these almost 2 weeks ago and absolutely love them. I walk my dog 2-3 times a day for 1-3 miles a walk. I live in northern IL USA, while I haven’t been able to test them on snow, they hold up in rain extremely well as advertised. I walked through a steady light rain and wet grass for about 30 minutes last night and my feet stayed completely dry. Using them on the sidewalk/road so much I fear I’ll wear most of the good tread off but we will see come winter. I have yet to completely submerge my foot in water with them on, but I also don’t intend to. The size fits true as I ordered my usual and it’s perfect. They aren’t too warm for insulated shoes either. Definitely still lighter than hiking boots. Might buy another pair for backups!"
Nike,2023-07-23,"Ok the shoes are great BUT PLEASE DONT LISTEN TO THESE REVIEWS ABOUT SIZE. These are TRAIL shoes. They are suppose to have a more snug fit. Because I listened to the reviews I now own them too big rather than my ACTUAL size and they are sold out of my size. The toe box is wide and spacious. The ankle support is excellent. HOWEVER, if you get them too big and try to trail run or worse, hike, you will slide in these and run the risk of way too much movement inside the shoe, as I am experiencing. They are fantastic shoes and look great. DO NOT go a full size up. If anything just a half size but that ended up WAY TOO BIG for me."

Nike,2023-11-29,"Needed a waterproof, trail runner that came in earth tones for a trip to Africa (can only pack limited items and needed a shoe that could survive rainy hikes in Cape Town and work on safari in Botswana). After multiple searches kept leading to the Nike Pegasus. I wore Nike Pegasus (non-GTX/non-trail) for years until I discovered the Brooks Ghost two years ago. I’ve used in wet weather and they seem okay. Big trip isn’t for months but I’m starting wear-in process now.For reference, I wear 10.5 in non-GTX Nike Pegasus and Brooks Ghost, no sizing adjustment was needed."
Nike,2024-02-07,"This is my second pair of Pegasus Trail 4 running shoes. Their waterproofing and cushioning performance is excellent and they have a good tread for exercising in slippery conditions. In the colder months, I also use them in drier conditions because they perform so well. Because of their waterproof GORE-TEX fabrication, they are not as breathable as mesh running shoes made for hot weather running, but I find that a feature, not a problem. When it's hot I will relegate their usage to wet weather again. Recommended!"
Nike,2023-07-25,"These shoes will NOT protect your feet. The half toe cap leaves toes unprotected. I scraped, bumped, stubbed my toes on rocks while running over rocks, roots, branches, etc. Also, these shoes have ZERO upper support. If you are walking on any kind of angle--hill, boulder, root--your foot just slides off the footbed and over the sides of the shoe. If you are walking on your flat, paved neighborhood street, these shoes are great. Easily the worst shoe for the money I've ever purchased"
Nike,2024-01-17,"They are amazing as far as all weather ability and versatility. I use them for disc golf, and love them 10X more than any pair of Merrill’s or keens. I would truly give them like a *4.5 star rating, because of the rubber material the outer sole is made of, wears down quickly playing Disc golf, so then your traction for the trails and elevation changes suffers a little bit. Only under the toe box mainly. The only other gripe is one of my 4 pairs, over time, my toe broke through the top of the toe box. Putting enough hours/miles in though, that’s to be expected."
Nike,2023-07-11,"I was worried when purchasing these that they would hurt my feet due to the waterproof nature of the shoe. I primarily have Nike shoes, and they are always very comfortable, but I’m used to a running shoe that is airy and light. I was SO pleasantly surprised with this shoe! It was just as comfortable as any other Nike I own, and it doesn’t hurt my feet at all! It’s slightly warmer when I tried them, but that is due to it being waterproof (and therefore air proof as well). This was the best purchase! Thanks for making a great waterproof shoe!"

There is also a small pink smudge on the heel, unexpected for a shoe this price.The color and style are nice and as expected. They are also comfy to walk in and feel supportive."
Nike,2023-11-13,"I love Nike to start off with so when I was looking for new sneakers, I was hoping to find some in my size but unfortunately all then women’s in my size were gone. So thankfully I know my size in men and found these air max which are always my go to. I love shopping for my sneakers at academy but I do wish you would get more inventory for certain sizes. Other than that , they were shipped out and I received them quickly. I was very satisfied with the order and shipping process."
Nike,2023-06-07,"These Nike Air Max shoes feel very comfortable and are great for everyday walking around and perfect for athletic performance such as jogging, playing a pickup game of basketball and/or a tennis match. They were a great price at Shoe Carnival and really made me feel like I got excellent value for my money! Great pair of shoes and great price point! I will be buying these shoes again!"
Nike,2024-02-18,"Have purchased the ""monarch"" and still have 2 pair that I absolutely love! Was looking to add to my ""air"" collection for the soon upcoming nice weather and increased walking activity. I will probably return the recent purchase and await your next sale/special. Even increasing a full size has not improved the comfort level of the shoes"
Nike,2024-02-04,"Ordered 2 pair in my normal 10.5 Nike Air size and these were WAY too small. Will be returning and not reordering. Was also a little upset as 1 if the boxes had the lid completely ripped off and burn pair of shoes had been previously worn/tried on. Recommend going up a full size if you're dead set, but these were all around disappointing. Do better Academy!!"
Nike,2023-08-03,Bought these for my wife and she absolutely loves them. Colors are gorgeous. Materials/textures used add nice depth to the overall look. Wife says they are super comfortable to wear for long periods of time. There was some concern that they might run small initially but she can confidently say they are true to size now that they have been broken in.
Nike,2023-09-05,"Extremely disappointed... They look great and feel ok. But less than two weeks after buying them, they both started squeaking with EVERY STEP! Super embarrassing and aggravating... One of the very few times in my life, that Nike has disappointed Me.... I had to return them. . . Then went with a different brand... C'mon Nike, it's 2023! Do y'all even product test anymore? Or just manufacturer as many as possible as cheap as possible? This was straight up, unacceptable. Y'all GOTTA Step your game up!"
Nike,2018-04-21,"To Whom It May Concern,On April 7 2018 my wife and I purchased two pairs of sneakers, one pair for myself and one pair for her at store #579 located in Neshaminy Mall in Bensalem Pa. The sneakers I got were Nike Reax 8 TR Mesh, very comfortable and look great. Within 3 days I thought I heard a noise coming from the left sneaker and on the 5th day the squeaking noise was extremely loud.

I asked for the manager and Jessica said she was the manger. I proceeded to tell her about my sneakers and the noise they were making. Jessica's exact words were I CAN'T HELP YOU BECAUSE YOU WALKED IN MY STORE WITH THOSE SNEAKERS ON YOUR FEET. I had to leave the store walk in the mall to a bench take the shoes off my feet walk back to your store in my socks and hand her the bag. After all that she rolled her eyes and asked if I wanted the same pair I said yes but you did not have the same color but I received the same sneaker but a different color. I could not believe how she handled the situation. After a few days with the new sneakers started to squeak again. On April 20, 2018 I decide to return the sneakers again and get a different style or type of sneaker. When I went into the store this time I made sure the shoes were in the box with the bag and my receipt. When I approached the register The cashier needed an override and asked for the manager in which Jessica came to the counter and said exact words YOU WAS IN HERE LAST WEEK AND I'M NOT DOING THIS AGAIN BECAUSE I'M LOOSING MONEY. The way she said that and the pitch of her voice made me speechless. I always thought loosing good customers who shop here for their children like my wife and I would make your company loose money, good customer service never Less"
Nike,2022-09-13,"These shoes look great and a very comfortable. However after wearing them awhile I remembered why I don't normally buy Nike shoes. The build quality is very poor. The adhesive and layers in the soles are failing after very light use and make an awful squeaking noise that sounds like you've walked in a puddle and are now walking on a polished tile floor while trying to be as annoying as possible.If you only wear them in places that are loud it might be okay, but if you're walking on any surface in a normal environment then you'll be squeaking with every step."

Nike,2022-08-17,"I bought a pair of these because they were so comfortable in the store. Met us with some friends about a week later and my buddy said he had a pair like them and that they started squeaking after about 2 weeks. Played it off and sure enough, one week later they started this annoying squeak. Should have returned them but kept them because they were really comfortable. The outer stared falling apart and they became grass cutting shoes. Don't buy these unless you want some really fancy grass shoes."
Nike,2023-06-05,This is my 2nd pair of Reax 8 Training shoes. Both of them began to squeak after about 3 to 4 months. They are comfortable. I use them at the gym for weight lifting and at physical therapy. The squeak is starting to get on my nerves and is embarrassing as you walk past people with your squeaky shoes.
Nike,2020-10-27,"I've owned a few pairs of this exact shoe over the past few years. They are generally comfortable. Tread pattern appears unimpressive and shallow, so that wears pretty quickly, but I didn't find that to be a problem from a function standpoint.The squeak/click that began a couple of weeks into my first pair was upsetting. It sounded like a small rock was stuck in the tread. Through research and experimentation I figured out how to fix the ""squeak"". I spray a little bit of WD-40 into the spot where each strut joints the bottom of the shoe, approaching from the outside of the shoe. (See picture) Periodically, I need to re-do the WD-40 treatment, especially if i get the shoes significantly wet with water."
Nike,2024-02-26,Worst shoe ever!! Squeaks loudly after a day of walking. I trained in them once and they started making noise. I started only wearing them on rainy days to make it make sense. Donâ€™t buy this shoe unless youâ€™re fine with everybody turning to stare at you and your squeaky shoes.
Nike,2022-12-23,"Comfortable, and on were on sale---but! After two days the sole on the left shoe started squeaking and has gotten louder. Soon the right shoe joined in. Fortunately someone else had mentioned that in a review so I ordered a pair of the SC running shoes (also on sale) as back up. These are my outdoor shoes now. They are pretty annoying inside, but great outside with background noise!"
Nike,2023-07-25,"I love the no hassle, no problems I received from academy sports. com. I would definitely order from them again. I think it's wonderful to order from someone with no complications, it's making ordering the way it should be, pleasant. In ending I love my nike reax, very nice sneakers."

I had that with previous Nike shoes I used to own years ago and it didn't bother me at all. This time it did bother me and I'm not happy. For that, I won't be buying Nike shoes again. Why should I spend so much money on a pair of shoes to inflict pain and discomfort on myself? It's ridiculous. That is not on so thats why I gave it a one star rating.

Nike,2023-12-08,"Purchased on a Thursday at 15:00, arrived the Friday at 12:00. Great delivery, and the trainers look great at first glance. The white midsole has a light speckled effect which wasn’t clear on photos but looks nice in person. There was a piece of tape securing the box closed which was appreciated, however there is no protective paper in the shoebox with the trainers just placed inside. These are a gift so haven’t worn them but on close inspection there are a few minor imperfections where the midsole meets the trainer and areas where glue is used - not an issue for me nor gift recipient but would definitely bother a serious sneaker-head."
Nike,2023-02-18,"recently picked up a pair of Nike Court Vision Low sneakers and I have to say, I'm really impressed! First of all, they look great - the classic design is super clean and versatile. But beyond their good looks, they're also incredibly comfortable. The insole has a nice amount of cushioning, and the upper is made from a durable yet breathable material. In terms of sizing, I found them to be true to size - I went with my usual size and they fit perfectly.One thing I really love about these sneakers is that they have a similar aesthetic to the iconic Air Force 1's, but with a less chunky profile.

Nike,2023-12-15,"I bought these as a Christmas gift for my son. I sat in a corner for about a week after it was delivered until I was ready to wrap it and put it under the Christmas tree. When I opened them I noticed the box was damaged and there was no paper in the box. I took the shoes out and they were already worn. It looked like someone ran through a field of wet grass, let the grass fry on the shoes and put them back in the box. I sent them back and asked for a replacement. The processed the exchange and when I got the next order it was the exact same shoes. I took it back to the store and requested a refund."
Nike,2023-05-21,"I prefer the Court Vision over Air Force 1 because it’s not expensive to replace when they get worn out. They’re much better for everyday wear when you don’t want to wear out the Air Force 1s. I bought a pair of these Navy Blue and I can’t tell them apart from the black ones I have because the blue is too dark. I wish they would make these with blue on the bottom so they stay looking cleaner and actually make the blue visible. I think people think they’re buying Air Force 1s when they buy Court Vision, they’re not fake. Court Vision is a cheaper style but still a very comfortable durable shoe."
Nike,2024-01-14,"I ordered it on 12.12 and I received it on Dec 14. The delivery was fast. The item is good, it has the right size and authentic as it should be. But I don't think that's the right and box for the item? I could be wrong. Also, I have a problem with the packaging. Upon opening, you can't barely remove the box from the packaging. They didn't put an allowance during packaging or the packaging was just too small and too tight. That's why the box has dents on it upon unboxing. Nonetheless, it's a good deal. 2 day delivery time."
Nike,2022-12-04,"I loved the style of these shoes. I got the grey with red swoosh. However the quality is atrocious. They use stiff, hard materials. It almost feels like you’re walking around in clogs. From the rubber on the bottoms, to the “leather” they use for the uppers. It’s all hard. Needless to say, the insoles are trash too. You may as well plan on adding that to your cart immediately. Another issue was the top of the shoe are so high they rub against my ankle bone, so I had to double up the heel part of the insole to alleviate some of the rubbing. Go Nike!Nothing bad to say about Academy though, they are always stellar. Friendly staff, always there to help if you need it, and great return policy, although I chose to keep these as a part-time shoe."
Nike,2023-10-12,"I love the classic clean look. This is a very comfortable elegant yet sporty looking shoe. I love the color scheme it matches perfectly with my University of Alabama apparel, roll tide. I'm a middle aged guy that loves sneakers. The moment I saw these sneakers they were a must have for me! This was a great buy economically and fashion wise. I love them definitely a must have for sneaker enthusiasts."
Nike,2024-01-08,These are some of the most comfortable shoes I’ve bought in awhile. So comfortable I bought another pair

Nike,2024-02-14,"The Nike kill shot 2 sneaks are so fresh! Unique and tiny retro vibes! These shoes are so comfortable! They are not wide foot friendly but that doesn’t bother me. The gummy soles provide excellent traction. I’ve only had mine for a few months and they look like they came straight out the box still!! The do only have minor support, defiantly more of fashion statement than a workout shoe. I will forever have a pair of these in my closet!"
Nike,2023-07-03,"I never write reviews and buy at least 15 pairs of nikes per year. These may be the best shoe they have ever made. I just wish they came back out with the green ones. When they made this pair 6 years ago, it was a collab with j crew, and they only went up to size 12. I begged and I hope other people did too, and they finally caved in summer of 2018. They fit perfect, are versatile, look great on every foot, and all stylish. Great contrast and can wear with anything…..also BRING BACK THE LUCID GREEN!"
Nike,2022-05-18,"These shoes have a ton of flexibility. Can be dressed up or down. A solid, classic, yet modern vibe that can help you stand out from the crowd. Good quality construction with the gum yellow and textured leathers. Literally an everyday shoe. Ordered the desert orange....haven't seen another pair on anyone. I've probably been asked about them 50+ times.I would order 3 more pairs if they had them in stock. Dreaming of a maroon colorway to drop."
Nike,2019-11-18,"Nice, light-weight shoe with a modern look that exudes style. It is made with quality materials; though, the leather is a little on the shiny side, it is still a decent quality leather. These are not spongy in feel; rather, you feel a little lower to the ground, but still feeling comfortable with a good amount of cushioning. These are good for all-day wear with no foot fatigue that I can tell.They did crease in the toe area, just in front of the suede trim after the first day of wear, but nothing that would be a deal-breaker. The color has different hues of off white. Though subjective, I like the contrasting rubber sole and lower trim.All in all, I really like these shoes for a casual, comfortable look."
Nike,2024-04-05,They're awesome! The leather feels super high-quality and they've gotten more comfortable the more I wear them. They look great with pretty much everything and the grip is solid too. Totally recommend if you're into sneakers that are both stylish and comfy!
Nike,2021-03-31,"I am a nike fan through and through. From Cortez to Pegasus, almost all my non-dress shoes are nike, so i really do not like writing a negative review First off, these were a half-size too big in length. at that half-size too big, they were very narrow. I wear a 9.5 in the Nike Free RN, Nike Pegasus, and Nike Cortez. So, I ordered a 9.5. they were slightly narrow on the width, and at least a half size too long. Not to mention the overall cushion seems to be lacking. All this in mind I am returning them. I would try to get them in another size, but they are no longer available.... i made this purchase with two other items, and another item was not available after ordering... so i got one of three items i ordered to work... thanks for socks.."
Nike,2023-03-02,"Don’t ever stop making these shoes. I’ve bought many pairs in all different colors, and I’ll keep buying more as long as they’re sold. They’re such classic shoes with a streamlined and modern look, and they’re super comfortable. My only complaint is that I wear them so much I have beat each pair up pretty badly. Wish I could keep a pair fresh. If you’re even considering, don’t think just get ‘em."
Nike,2023-11-16,"I live in a place that rains a lot, has red dirt, and I ride a bike to and from work every day. These Killshots are my go to shoe for a when I want something white and clean in this environment. They are easy to clean and look great. StockX delivered them quickly and in good condition."
Nike,2024-02-26,The Nike Killshot 2 has a vintage style that looks great with shorts or jeans. The upper leather is of good quality and the suede toe and heal along with the gum some make for nice a contrast. They are comfortable but don’t offer a lot of arch support so I wear my own insoles.
Nike,2023-11-06,"I love the Nike Killshot 2’s! An absolute classic that has remained simple, understated and versatile! I can wear these to work or lounging around and they suit either purpose just fine. I wear a size 10 in Nike and they fit perfect."
Nike,2024-01-25,"I am so incredibly disappointed in these shoes. The red color bleeds through to the white toe. My son got a bit of dirt on the white toes on the bus. I simply wiped them off with a washrag and the red bled through. This should not happen for what we paid. They were a Christmas gift and now after wearing them once, they look like crap. I'm disappointed that Dicks wouldn't return them when we were within the return window."
Nike,2023-04-11,"These are great casual shoes, and are comfortable for the price. I picked them up on a whim and haven’t been disappointed at all. They are true to size for the most part but I wouldn’t recommend if you have a wider foot, they felt a little narrow to me. They come in several nice colorways and look good with shorts (khaki or athletic), or a nice pair of joggers. If you’re looking for a performance runner then this isn’t the shoe for you, but if you want something that looks nice and feels good for some casual walking then these will definitely work."
Nike,2022-09-07,My son needed a good pair of shoes to start off the school year. he had been eyeing these shoes for sometime now. he says that they're very comfortable I like the style because it goes with everything he wears. He wears them all the time. Nagy always has great designs and good quality shoes. It would just be nice for the kind of money you spend on Nike shoes they would give you much higher quality insoles for lasting comfort.
Nike,2023-09-04,"I bought these just to wear with certain outfits. I like buying different shoes that are different colors to match different outfits. These are so comfortable. I don't really wear them playing sports, but I could wear them every day because they feel so good."
Nike,2024-02-03,"I like the colors and style of these, but they are truly the most uncomfortable sneakers I've ever worn. The material is so stiff, even after 2 months. It's like wearing cinderblocks in your feet. they're going right in a donation box."
Nike,2024-02-28,"This store never has the sizes I or my son need. Everytime we go, we have to look at like 5pairs before we fixed a pair in our size. In an 11 and he is 11.5"
Nike,2023-05-23,I bought these for my son over month ago. He wears them almost every day and they still look brand new. He says they are very comfortable and he loves them. They are his go to choice for his every day sneaker.
Nike,2022-08-30,Nike changed the design to a new no tongue one piece style. Couldn't get my foot in the shoe to see if it even fit without the heal collapsing. Took about five minutes to try to get the shoes on. Returned them to Dicks and there was no hassle with the return. The Problem wasn't with Dick's Sports. The problem was with Nike.]
Nike,2023-09-06,I like these so far. They are a good looking shoe. You can definitely feel that the heel is higher than the toe. More so than other shoes I have owned. I’m hoping they break in a bit to alleviate this.
Nike,2022-09-03,"Like another reviewer said, this has a wider toe box. This fits so much better than the regular Nike Air Max 90 and is cheaper. I wish they would make more colors other than the white with a diff color swoosh, but still. These are more comfortable and look the same for much cheaper."
Nike,2023-11-14,Very comfortable!! Great looking... Not squeaky lo.....l don't try to return!They tried to say I wore them before taking them back. I didnt even try them on! I didn't linger the fabric..I was so embarrassed and insulted the way the manager was telling her boss about the shoes.I received them that way.They tried to tell me they weren't going to return them. I got angry and said fine I'll do it and I'm calling corporate and I need your name because her name tag was covered.That's when they agreed to return and took 30+ minutes doing so.I will never buy anything from Hibbetts Sports again.I will tell everyone I know about my experience.
Nike,2023-09-30,"Easily ordered and delivery was before promised delivery date i received that's ok. Onto the actual trainers, they are great material, great fit, infact I wore them straight away inside the house no issues. However on the second day of wearing them, it is if the bubble on the sole has burst and I am getting a noise each time I place my foot on the floor then lift it up, was in the supermarket and each step I took is annoying.i could return them but I cannot be bothered, just going to write them off and hand into local charity shop. So giving them a 2 star as I got to wear them outside for one day before they started to make a squeak. Dissapointed."
Nike,2023-04-30,"Great fit, perfect everyday wear for my 11 year son. He hasn't complained not once since I bought him those shoes. And thet is hard to make happen. So that you Academy for having such great products to sell. And a special thanks to Nike for making the shoe that my son loves so much and fits his everyday needs. They help him run better and he doesnt side and they grip the ground. Thanks again"
Nike,2024-02-20,"Love the look of these shoes, but they squeak! And it isn't a faint squeak, it is full on dog toy squeak, it is embarrassing for my son. This is the second pair, thought no way would the second pair squeak, but sure enough it has a squeak, but even louder than the first!.... Disappointed for my son, the other kids are giving him grief about the loud squeak.Won't buy again"
Nike,2023-12-01,"I love these shoes! I've bought three pair now and all three squeak!!! it really sucks because it's hard enough to find shoes because I'm a bigger guy and wear either a size 14 or 15 which in the shoe I wear a 14. But when I find a shoe that I like, I usually try buying a few pair. This is definitely one of the most comfortable shoes I've ever had but my issue is, the three pair that I have bought of these all three pair squeak and that really sucks!!!"
Nike,2024-03-15,"I bought the air max alpha 5 for my son and I noticed a hole on his right foot three weeks later, near the bone inside of his big toe, the mesh broken from outside. I wasn’t sure if I can return since he wore them for 3 weeks. I brought them to shoe repairs and they won’t repair sneakers. I finally contacted ASOS and it has passed their deadline for returning. Not a good shopping experience."
Nike,2023-06-05,"These shoes are comfortable I want to wear everywhere but like others have said squeak squeak squeak rubber ducky is annoying, mine started on the right shoe then it stopped and started on the left one. I thought maybe I just had a bad set but obviously not. I have been wearing Air Max shoes for a long time and I can remember a set I bought several years back that were the same way."
Nike,2024-03-11,Picked these up to replace current running shoe for workouts. I bought this shoe 3 weeks ago and couldn't be happier. Very comfortable and supportive to my feed. The heel cushion is fantastic. Great for long walks. Ture to sizing and stable.
Nike,2024-02-15,"The shoes started coming apart less than one year after purchase. I didn't wear the shoes everyday. Per nike, they have a two year warranty. Went back to the store and was told they were unable to help me. Nike said send them back and if we decide it was a manufacturer defect they would replace the shoes, but there was no guarantee."
Nike,2023-08-14,These shoes are a perfect neutral. The colors go well with pretty much anything. My son chose them as his back-to-school shoes for 7th grade and was excited to wear them his first day! They clean up easily and fit as expected. They are not too wide or narrow. Perfection!
Nike,2024-02-14,"The Nike kill shot 2 sneaks are so fresh! Unique and tiny retro vibes! These shoes are so comfortable! They are not wide foot friendly but that doesn’t bother me. The gummy soles provide excellent traction. I’ve only had mine for a few months and they look like they came straight out the box still!! The do only have minor support, defiantly more of fashion statement than a workout shoe. I will forever have a pair of these in my closet!"
Nike,2023-07-03,"I never write reviews and buy at least 15 pairs of nikes per year. These may be the best shoe they have ever made. I just wish they came back out with the green ones. When they made this pair 6 years ago, it was a collab with j crew, and they only went up to size 12. I begged and I hope other people did too, and they finally caved in summer of 2018. They fit perfect, are versatile, look great on every foot, and all stylish. Great contrast and can wear with anything…..also BRING BACK THE LUCID GREEN!"
Nike,2022-05-18,"These shoes have a ton of flexibility. Can be dressed up or down. A solid, classic, yet modern vibe that can help you stand out from the crowd. Good quality construction with the gum yellow and textured leathers. Literally an everyday shoe. Ordered the desert orange....haven't seen another pair on anyone. I've probably been asked about them 50+ times.I would order 3 more pairs if they had them in stock. Dreaming of a maroon colorway to drop."
Nike,2019-11-18,"Nice, light-weight shoe with a modern look that exudes style. It is made with quality materials; though, the leather is a little on the shiny side, it is still a decent quality leather. These are not spongy in feel; rather, you feel a little lower to the ground, but still feeling comfortable with a good amount of cushioning. These are good for all-day wear with no foot fatigue that I can tell.They did crease in the toe area, just in front of the suede trim after the first day of wear, but nothing that would be a deal-breaker. The color has different hues of off white. Though subjective, I like the contrasting rubber sole and lower trim.All in all, I really like these shoes for a casual, comfortable look."
Nike,2024-04-05,They're awesome! The leather feels super high-quality and they've gotten more comfortable the more I wear them. They look great with pretty much everything and the grip is solid too. Totally recommend if you're into sneakers that are both stylish and comfy!
Nike,2021-03-31,"I am a nike fan through and through. From Cortez to Pegasus, almost all my non-dress shoes are nike, so i really do not like writing a negative review First off, these were a half-size too big in length. at that half-size too big, they were very narrow. I wear a 9.5 in the Nike Free RN, Nike Pegasus, and Nike Cortez. So, I ordered a 9.5. they were slightly narrow on the width, and at least a half size too long. Not to mention the overall cushion seems to be lacking. All this in mind I am returning them. I would try to get them in another size, but they are no longer available.... i made this purchase with two other items, and another item was not available after ordering... so i got one of three items i ordered to work... thanks for socks.."
Nike,2023-03-02,"Don’t ever stop making these shoes. I’ve bought many pairs in all different colors, and I’ll keep buying more as long as they’re sold. They’re such classic shoes with a streamlined and modern look, and they’re super comfortable. My only complaint is that I wear them so much I have beat each pair up pretty badly. Wish I could keep a pair fresh. If you’re even considering, don’t think just get ‘em."
Nike,2023-11-16,"I live in a place that rains a lot, has red dirt, and I ride a bike to and from work every day. These Killshots are my go to shoe for a when I want something white and clean in this environment. They are easy to clean and look great. StockX delivered them quickly and in good condition."
Nike,2024-02-26,The Nike Killshot 2 has a vintage style that looks great with shorts or jeans. The upper leather is of good quality and the suede toe and heal along with the gum some make for nice a contrast. They are comfortable but don’t offer a lot of arch support so I wear my own insoles.
Nike,2023-11-06,"I love the Nike Killshot 2’s! An absolute classic that has remained simple, understated and versatile! I can wear these to work or lounging around and they suit either purpose just fine. I wear a size 10 in Nike and they fit perfect."
Nike,2023-07-07,"Very nice looking shoes but its very uncomfortable. Its fits perfectly but the middle bit digs into the side of my feet and it hurts. I had that with previous Nike shoes I used to own years ago and it didn't bother me at all. This time it did bother me and I'm not happy. For that, I won't be buying Nike shoes again. Why should I spend so much money on a pair of shoes to inflict pain and discomfort on myself? It's ridiculous. That is not on so thats why I gave it a one star rating. Why does Nike design their shoes like that? Next time I buy new shoes I don't want the middle part to press against the side of my feet! Fortunately I was able to fix the issue and make it a lot less uncomfortable by removing the in-sole and swap it with the one from my old shoes.

Next time buy comfortable shoes instead of tolerable levels of discomfort you can allow. Less"
Nike,2023-09-03,"Originally ordered last 8.8 sale, but that order had issues with the product, so I refunded it and reordered again.

Nike,2023-12-08,"Purchased on a Thursday at 15:00, arrived the Friday at 12:00. Great delivery, and the trainers look great at first glance. The white midsole has a light speckled effect which wasn’t clear on photos but looks nice in person. There was a piece of tape securing the box closed which was appreciated, however there is no protective paper in the shoebox with the trainers just placed inside. These are a gift so haven’t worn them but on close inspection there are a few minor imperfections where the midsole meets the trainer and areas where glue is used - not an issue for me nor gift recipient but would definitely bother a serious sneaker-head."
Nike,2023-02-18,"recently picked up a pair of Nike Court Vision Low sneakers and I have to say, I'm really impressed! First of all, they look great - the classic design is super clean and versatile. But beyond their good looks, they're also incredibly comfortable. The insole has a nice amount of cushioning, and the upper is made from a durable yet breathable material. In terms of sizing, I found them to be true to size - I went with my usual size and they fit perfectly.One thing I really love about these sneakers is that they have a similar aesthetic to the iconic Air Force 1's, but with a less chunky profile.

Nike,2023-12-15,"I bought these as a Christmas gift for my son. I sat in a corner for about a week after it was delivered until I was ready to wrap it and put it under the Christmas tree. When I opened them I noticed the box was damaged and there was no paper in the box. I took the shoes out and they were already worn. It looked like someone ran through a field of wet grass, let the grass fry on the shoes and put them back in the box. I sent them back and asked for a replacement. The processed the exchange and when I got the next order it was the exact same shoes. I took it back to the store and requested a refund."
Nike,2023-05-21,"I prefer the Court Vision over Air Force 1 because it’s not expensive to replace when they get worn out. They’re much better for everyday wear when you don’t want to wear out the Air Force 1s. I bought a pair of these Navy Blue and I can’t tell them apart from the black ones I have because the blue is too dark. I wish they would make these with blue on the bottom so they stay looking cleaner and actually make the blue visible. I think people think they’re buying Air Force 1s when they buy Court Vision, they’re not fake. Court Vision is a cheaper style but still a very comfortable durable shoe."
Nike,2024-01-14,"I ordered it on 12.12 and I received it on Dec 14. The delivery was fast. The item is good, it has the right size and authentic as it should be. But I don't think that's the right and box for the item? I could be wrong. Also, I have a problem with the packaging. Upon opening, you can't barely remove the box from the packaging. They didn't put an allowance during packaging or the packaging was just too small and too tight. That's why the box has dents on it upon unboxing. Nonetheless, it's a good deal. 2 day delivery time."
Nike,2022-12-04,"I loved the style of these shoes. I got the grey with red swoosh. However the quality is atrocious. They use stiff, hard materials. It almost feels like you’re walking around in clogs. From the rubber on the bottoms, to the “leather” they use for the uppers. It’s all hard. Needless to say, the insoles are trash too. You may as well plan on adding that to your cart immediately. Another issue was the top of the shoe are so high they rub against my ankle bone, so I had to double up the heel part of the insole to alleviate some of the rubbing. Go Nike!Nothing bad to say about Academy though, they are always stellar. Friendly staff, always there to help if you need it, and great return policy, although I chose to keep these as a part-time shoe."
Nike,2023-10-12,"I love the classic clean look. This is a very comfortable elegant yet sporty looking shoe. I love the color scheme it matches perfectly with my University of Alabama apparel, roll tide. I'm a middle aged guy that loves sneakers. The moment I saw these sneakers they were a must have for me!

Nike,2024-03-28,I bought these runners a month ago to help with a foot problem. And I have to say they’re AMAZINGLY comfortable
Nike,2023-06-06,"Great pair of bball kicks! The lockdown, fit and traction are top tier. After a very short break-in period (1 game) the cushioning setup with the Zoom Turbo unit in the forefoot and the top-loaded zoom unit in the heel are very comfortable and bouncy. The cushioning isn't mushy and it has very nice court feel as they feel very close to the ground. The materials don't feel ultra premium but still feel nice. Breathable uppers help too. I went TTS with my normal width foot and it feels snug but comfortable. These are lighter and feel less clunky than the Lebron 20s. Happy with my purchase."
Nike,2023-12-08,"My 12 year old wanted these shoes for his basketball season. He loves them. He said they are super comfortable, have great traction, and they feel lightweight - making footwork easier.Price point seemed high personally, but I’m used to buying kids shoes at a cheaper price than adult shoes. He’s moved into sizes and the price is comparable with other basketball shoes."
Nike,2023-11-03,Happy grandson! My grandson neededshoes for basketball. He's into basket ball players and the shoes they endorse. The last time i took him to buy shoes it took two hours. He tried on every shoe and told me who endorsed each one. He ended up with the first pair he tried on. So i surprised him with the Nike LeBron nxxt Gen. Hes a very happy young man.
Nike,2023-06-21,"These are absolutely fantastic shoes that look even better in person!! The colourway provides a unique, bold look! I recommend going a half size up for the perfect fit. These not only look great, but they are also excellent performance shoes for all the HOOPERS out there! Very durable sole. Must buy."
Nike,2023-08-29,I bought these about 6 days ago very happy with how fast they came! Awesome shoes love how they match my team colors . Very comfortable and fit true to size I would recommend these to any type of player. they are very light weight and very supportive feeling I’m a big guy that’s very light on my feet and these feel amazing definitely would get them again!
Nike,2024-02-29,"I purchased these shoes to play basketball after years of not playing and so far they have been great. They are very comfortable and feel sturdy. I am curious to see how they hold up as I continue to play and break them in a bit. Also, the extra pair of laces jazz them up a bit. Ninja Turtle green!"
Nike,2024-03-30,"I bought these, but the red and black colorway for my 13 yr old son back in November. Half way through his bball season he began complaining how badly worn the grip on these became and was slipping during games. They do not last. Disappointing."
Nike,2023-06-16,"After watching and reading review about the Lebron 20 Nxxt Gen, I was greatly impressed by the preformance and comfort of them. After not playing basketball for many years these shoes have give me the support and comfort I needed to boost my confidence in my foot work on the court. Highly recommend these shoes in any colourway"
Nike,2023-09-24,These shoes are like a work of art. Many different materials and all of them feel very high quality. This makes for snug and secure comfortable fit. The Road Map of Akron on the bottom of the sole is just the coolest. I am obsessed with these shoes.
Nike,2023-06-14,"Extremely happy with the shoes as it is very difficult to find a pair of basketball shoes with a wide toe box that fits my feet well. They play great, good traction, very nice under-foot cushioning system and overall quite a comfortable shoes to wear. Go a half size up though if you happen to have a slightly wider feet like me."
Nike,2024-02-09,"I love the textured feel of the leather portion. Almost cloth-like. This is my third pair of the Ja 1 and each one has a slightly different feel. This one seems tighter and more supportive, so i am breaking them in slowly. Definitely look great in person, color is more of a dusty rose. My fav color of the 3. Awesome basketball shoe. Very light and explosive response."

Nike,2023-11-15,"These were a present for my Godson, the shoes were in perfect condition, but the box had a torn flap on the lid when they arrived. Based on the way the box was sitting inside of the shipping box, I believe the damage occurred when StockX was packing them up to ship to me."
