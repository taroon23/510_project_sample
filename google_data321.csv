Under Armour,1,48.75,2024-03-18,4.6,"Great toe spread, great cushion and support. Almost feel a spring in my step. Great for the gym too which is why I got them. My feet stay in place when doing planks meaning my toes are not pushing into the floor so no toe cramps. I am glad I got them, I don't run unfortunately but they are great on the stair climber and could easily stand on hard floor for hours in them. My foot is a 12.5 so size 13 worked great although if my foot were an actual 13 I am not sure if they would fit perfect."
Under Armour,1,48.75,2024-03-29,4.6,I have several pairs of these shoes in several different colors. Thes shoes are by far the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. I love that they come in a 4 EE because I have a wide foot. I always talked about how comfortable my Sketchers shoes were until I bought these Under Armour shoes. Now they are the only shoes I will wear. They hold up very well and they are nice looking shoes . I would recommend them to everyone.
Under Armour,1,48.75,2023-12-20,4.6,"I absolutely love the way these shoes fit, and that means a lot as I have difficulty finding shoes that fit like these. In particular for me the low/neutral arch fits much better than so many shoes with higher arches. And the new generation of the Charged Assert line, which I've been wearing for years, has some great improvements. A wider base and more cushioning from the heel through the toe feels great. I feel like it is even promoting a better roll of my foot from heel to toe as I walk."
Under Armour,1,48.75,2023-06-17,4.6,"I need extra wide (4E) fit and have only found a couple shoes that do the job and one discontinued recently. I tried on 4 other brands before I found these gems (my last chance). They felt a little short in the store however I took them home anyways and wore them a little to try them out. I could of lived with them but when I tried 1/2 size larger (10 to 10 1/2) wow I had the right fit!What people mean by 'old man shoes""? Some feet run wide. That is not cool to say that."
Under Armour,1,48.75,2024-01-12,4.6,My husband is 6’9” with a size 15 shoe. So shoe shopping for him can be a pain. Finding these in his size with an extra wide option was amazing. He’s worn them almost every day since Christmas. He reports they are super comfy and supportive. 0 complaints at this time. They are also really sharp looking and match most outfits.
Under Armour,1,48.75,2024-03-28,4.6,"I was happy to finally get a pair of shoes under the 4E category, however unfortunately this pair seem to hurt my last toes, so it is vlreally uncomfortable when I walk longer distances.I did not have this problem w my earlier pair.It is also not as cushiony as I wld have loved it, unlike New Balance which I tried.Anyway, what can I do to ease the pain on my toes?Thank u"
Under Armour,1,48.75,2024-04-22,4.6,I have a difficult time finding shoes wide enough to to fit my foot width years ago i tried on another brands 4E width shoe and found what I was looking for in comfort. I have Purchased an EE width UA shoe from Amazon but they still have not stretched enough to be really comfortable. Upon going into one of the near by UA stores I found that they had a 4E with in many different styles tried it on in size 9 and needed to go to a 9 1/2 for the correct length and found the comfort I was looking for in a very supportive shoe.
Under Armour,1,48.75,2024-03-12,4.6,"My son is over 6 foot tall and over 300 pounds and the shoe works very well. He’s got a 13 four wide foot which is extremely difficult to fit fits like a glove. He can put them on and take right off with them. There’s no breaking, which I don’t believe is true for shoes anyway they should feel good right off the get-go, but this is probably our Third year that we found under Armour shoes for him and their fantastic"
Under Armour,1,48.75,2024-04-10,4.6,"I purchased this shoe for my husband who has a wider foot and he has always struggled with finding shoes wide enough. This shoe was wide and comfortable for him. The look is very clean and slick. The only downside, as with any new shoe, is breaking it in. Other than that, I would and will be purchasing this brand/shoe again."
Under Armour,1,48.75,2024-04-10,4.6,I’ve been getting this model sneaker for the past 5 years. They usually last about a year till the soles compress and they’re not comfortable anymore. For some reason this pair only lasted 6 months. It’s almost like the shoe has no padding anymore. They were very comfortable new.

The cushioning system effectively absorbs impact, reducing fatigue during extended play. The breathability of the materials used keeps my feet cool and comfortable throughout the game.Durability is key for any basketball shoe, and the UA Lockdown 6 does not disappoint. The build quality is robust, and after several intense games, the shoes still look and perform like new.

Under Armour,2,70.0,2023-12-18,4.7,"These shoes are nice but have issues. First and foremost, the shoe runs small - for me it is at least a half size small. I just ordered another pair of UA running shoes and these are at least a half size smaller. I had to exchange for the next size up and they are still a touch on the tight size. I am, hoping that the upper loosens up a bit and they will be awesome if that happens.The upper has very little give so right now they are uncomfortable. The base of the shoe is great and comfortable, but narrow and a touch short. I am not sure if that is because they market this as a unisex shoe and have made the outsole smaller to accommodate more smaller feet.The shoe looks great and my fingers are crossed that a break in will include loosening of the uppers.

My feet are 288mm and normally a medium width - look at the lace area - you can see where it is widening out near my leg and you can see how narrow the toe box is of this shoe.If your feet are on the small/narrow side, this could be a great shoe for you. I am 6'1"" and weight 180. Less"
Under Armour,2,70.0,2024-03-16,4.7,"I'm a professional trainer and was looking for a pair of shoes that were both comfortable and supportive for a long day on the floor of the gym. I was reluctant to purchase shoes that were advertised as basketball shoes, but liked the design so I gave them a try. They passed the test. I'm a D width and they run just a tad narrow, but they relaxed after a shift at the gym. I wear orthotics and the only downside is the insoles are not removeable. However, they work just fine with my orthotics. The only problem is I wear a 3mm lift in my left shoe, and that combined with the orthotics made the shoe too tights. The ultimate testament is I'm purchasing a back up pair in a different color."
Under Armour,2,70.0,2023-05-09,4.7,"I bought these for my daughter and myself for netball as we both have wide feet and other brands are just a smidge too tight. They r brilliant!! So comfortable and fit perfectly. And look good too. I bought them online, although I measured and sized as best I could, I was still a little nervous about getting them before trying them on, but they fit perfectly and very true to size. We have been wearing them for a few weeks now and we love them. I use them for both outdoor and indoor netball and my daughter also uses them for Netball and school sports. We both played our first game in the rain for this season and while everyone else was complaining about there feet soaking and freezing our were warm and dry."
Under Armour,2,70.0,2023-09-22,4.7,"Ordered these online to use for boxing workouts. Basketball shoes are often good for boxing, as many of the same foot movements are used. After a couple workouts, these shoes are just about perfect. Good support, especially side to side. The tread pattern is great for pivots. They seem to be good quality, and I like the ankle support, though I do wish it was a half-inch higher. All and all, just what I wanted. And unlike most basketball shows, these are far less than $100."
Under Armour,2,70.0,2023-08-13,4.7,"These shoes surprised me. They have a great fit, are built pretty well compared to some other name brands, and the grip has been superb. They have just enough cushion to where they absorb the shock but they dont sink you still get the solid court feel. They dont get overly dusty causing slippage, any ive got was easily wiped off real fast and back to playing. If you want a good shoe for playing basketball and not to show off, you would be pretty happy with these I think.The fit seems right on, if you have average width feet you should just get the size you normally do."
Under Armour,2,70.0,2024-02-06,4.7,"I wear these at the range, for tactical training and in my job as a photographer. They are comfortable standing or running around all day on flat or uneven surfaces. They look great with sweatpants, jeans or tactical pants. I have had several pairs and they hold up well. I wish they came in all black, I sometimes paint the white soles. A great UA product. I will continue to wear these for years to come."
Under Armour,2,70.0,2023-05-02,4.7,I was looking at these shoes originally for my daughter who had to choose this brand for her team. She looked at many options but kept coming back to these. We ordered a pair and then my son wanted a pair too. The kids like the design and how comfortable they are. My daughter plays competitive basketball and likes the grip better than other brands and appreciates the ankle support. These shoes are unisex and the sizing was perfect both of them.
Under Armour,2,70.0,2023-10-05,4.7,"These shoes are dope looking and I was excited to get them, but they are constructed so strangely. First, they run an entire size smaller than any other shoe I've ever bought. Second and most importantly, the arch in the shoe is so far forward (practically in the ball of my foot) that they are painful to wear. I tried exchanging them for a larger size, but had the same issue. Gonna have to admit defeat and just get a refund"
Under Armour,2,70.0,2023-07-22,4.7,"First off want to say the color combo ( black with neon green ) is such a great contrast. Secondly these are the most comfortable pair I have ever bought, all UA are top their in comfort but these are by far my favorite yet. They are so nicely made, no mistakes or opps,, they are seemless. I highly suggest these exact style to everyone now. Even bought my whole family their own pairs in different color combos ."

They weigh in at 9 oz, which is a little heavier than the previous model and has an offset of 10mm.It’s not an over-the-top fancy shoe but it’s everything you would need for a multipurpose shoe that allows you to use it for various occasions. Less"
Under Armour,3,85.3,2024-01-19,4.7,"Comfortable even after a full day of walking. It evenly hugs the entire foot without squeezing a specific part. It also has good cushioning, relieving the impact on the heel during running and walking. Satisfied with the purchase. The only problem is that white gets dirty easily, so you need to be careful and clean frequently. Therefore, Under Armor needs to ensure that the material will withstand much more frequent cleaning. I hope cleaning doesn't damage the sneakers."
Under Armour,3,85.3,2022-11-18,4.7,"I really liked how these fit , as well as the style! I purchased them for my son for school and he wore them nonstop! He really likes the way they fit. It’s now 3 months later and my 12 year old son is now in a Men’s 13wide. They have outlasted his growth spurt and even though these were worn every day and also for play they still are in great shape. Very impressed as to how little wear and tear they had. All of his other shoes that I purchased in the past were literally worn out in 1/2 the time! Highly recommend these and will be buying a size up for him for Christmas. I also like the arch support these gave and they have kept his feet from sweating. All things considered I definitely recommend these sneakers!"

They felt do good, that I bought a second pair. Looking forward to many walks and runs on these running shoes."
Under Armour,3,85.3,2023-06-12,4.7,I've only had the Underarmour Charged for a day but thus far I've been impressed They look very sharp and are very comfortable. I'm retired and I purchased them primarily for pleasure walking and golf. I much prefer these type of shoes over golf shoes both for comfort and cost. Another advantage of this brand is the multiple choices of color combinations. Although I'm not into fashion the different color choices allow me to always wear a pair of Underarmours that do not clash.
Under Armour,3,85.3,2023-05-03,4.7,"Appreciate the little details and the work to improve them that can be seen. Gonna post these pics. Also the back inside of the shoes may become messy.Ik everyones parameters and walking/running style is different, so it's not that simple. I use them for walking mostly.Wish you more quality and long lasting products, so that people love them and recommend to their friends. 4.5/5."
Under Armour,3,85.3,2023-07-20,4.7,"I love these sneakers, they come in wide widths which is hard for me to find. I have lymphdemia in one leg , with the swelling these shoes are awesome. I have purchased many pairs of this brand approximately 10+. I given them as gifts as well. They great cushion and the width is right on point. Try them I think you will be very satisfied. I even purchased a pair for my 8yr old grandson"

My previous pair of shoes wasn't doing the job, so I picked these up today at my local Famous Footwear. Immediately upon wearing them, my feet started to feel better. After wearing them for an entire day, the pain is nearly gone completely. I love these shoes and cannot express to you just how comfortable they are. I didn't even need to break them in for them to feel right. This is my first pair of Under Armour shoes, and it certainly won't be my last. Great job!"
Under Armour,3,85.3,2024-02-04,4.7,"The shoe is great. The colour is spon on, I have gone for the black and white strip version and it turns out to be great.

I got this for 45 CAD something and overall really satisfied with the product"
Under Armour,3,85.3,2023-07-17,4.7,Just got these 2 days ago and tried them out today. Very light and fit snug but comfortable. Size 8 and I usually order that. Walked 4.44 miles on pavement and gravel with uphill and downhill sections. No problems whatsoever. Can't comment on durability but seem well made. Probably not for trail hiking in rocky terrain but great for regular walking and running.

Under Armour,4,64.99,2022-07-08,4.6,"Nice fitting shoe. I am using this shoe for a baseball turf. Although this isn't the intended use for this shoe, it works perfectly. The shoe is affordable and sturdy. The drawback I see is this is a running shoe and the one advantage the actual baseball turf shoe has is the aggressive sole that works much better for the baseball field. The overall disadvantage for for me is Under Armour does not make enough shoes available for guys like me in a 4E width shoe. They would get much more business from me if I didn't have to bounce around shoe manufactures looking for the correct shoe size."

Under Armour,4,64.99,2022-11-22,4.6,"I have always been impressed with Under Armour shoes. Easy fit and last much longer than other sports shoes for me. As a school teacher, I used to buy new shoes each year, because they would be worn out. The last pair I bought have lasted 5 years. The only reason I needed new ones is because I have been on a weight loss program and I needed a size smaller than those shoes are! They are still in great shape. I’m happy to have a new pair and hope they last anywhere close to as long. Thanks for a consistently great product."
Under Armour,5,74.99,2024-01-16,4.5,"Shoes received very quick. Packaging good, no defects.Shoes look amazing and colours are good! I was worried the size might be smaller, and once I tried them, it was a small struggle to put them on but they fit perfectly. The opening area has thick cushion and helps grip your feet. Inner sole is soft and spongy. These are not waterproof though. Bottom sole has cool colour patterns but most importantly, they look high quality and should last a long time.My requirement is to have grippy shoes that doesnt easily slip, and these are good quality rubbers. Have to wear them for a few weeks to see if they hold up well. Good purchase overall!"
Under Armour,5,74.99,2024-03-14,4.5,"I was very happy that my feet fit these running shoes well. My left foot is wider than my right foot that makes buying a pair of shoes a challenge. UA store associate has the same feet width problems as myself and brought me these shoes. I went up a half size and the fit is amazing, super comfortable. I'm no jogger or runner but I love the fit of these shoes for everyday wear. These shoes are superlight weight and I wear them daily. I reccomend that you have a UA associate help you find the right shoes for your feet. Not all UA shoes fit me comfortably and the UA associates are knowledgeable on UA shoes."
Under Armour,5,74.99,2024-02-18,4.5,"These shoes are exactly as pictured. They are nice looking and very comfortable. As people stated in other reviews complaining about the sole not being grey. I am smart enough to know that it looks that way because it is a shadow from the photo. I originally order 3 colors in these shoes (Red, Academy, and Black/White). A couple days later I ordered the Mod gray color which IMO is the best looking pair of the four I ordered. I always wear running shoes for the comfort not for the purpose of running. I wear these as my day to day shoe as well as for long days of Bass fishing on my boat. I prefer the comfort and fit of a running shoe over any other shoe. Get you a pair!"
Under Armour,5,74.99,2023-12-11,4.5,"I've worn many pairs of running shoes over the course of my life and most of them have been bulky, hot, or didn't provide the comfort I expect from a shoe I'm going to wear for many miles. These shoes provided a light-weight, comfortable feel with sufficient ankle support for everyday running/ training. I use these for both running as well as strength conditioning and have no problem transitioning between activities. In the past I would need to wear 2 different pairs of shoes to maintain stability and meet the needs of these activities."
Under Armour,5,74.99,2023-09-20,4.5,"I love the UnderArmour shoes, but especially the Charged Pursuit. These are my third pair. They are so light weight it makes running super-easy, but they're also supportive. I do most of my running on the road, so I can't speak to trail performance...but on pavement or on the track, they're awesome. Definitely recommend. Sizing is standard - I had fears about ordering shoes without trying them on, but ordering in my regular shoe size (8.5) resulted in a perfect fit."
Under Armour,5,74.99,2024-04-12,4.5,They shipped them on time and took about a week to get to my house. When I first got them I thought they were a little ugly but after a couple days they really grew on me. They are super comfortable and and lightweight. Also they are really reliable and stylish. All in all I’m really glad I bought these and I am likely to buy another pair when i am done with these. I might even get a different color soon. Very satisfied.
Under Armour,5,74.99,2024-01-06,4.5,These sneakers exceeded my expectations. And the price is just right! My feet feel much better on the treadmill now. They also have a great look to them! I would definitely recommend them and will order them again in the future once they get worn down from extended use! My wife also loves her UA hovr running sneakers! Keep up the good work under armour!
Under Armour,5,74.99,2023-08-04,4.5,Shoes have amazing cushioning and are comfortable to run in. Very good functionality. But in terms of craftsmanship and appearance it fails horrendously at the stitching on the tongue. The shoes are hardly a month old and it's fraying on the label. Other than that this is a solid buy. The neon camo underside is a good design.
Under Armour,5,74.99,2024-04-04,4.5,My husband and I found a good deal on sneakers here through a credit card offer combined with a sale and grabbed a few pairs. He loved his so much he wanted to buy a second pair for work. He found the fit a bit tight but did not size up as they were still comfortable and he dislikes a loose fit. He works out a ton and walks/drives in 12 hour shifts. Very pleased with them. Go America
Under Armour,5,74.99,2024-02-11,4.5,I have been looking for a shoe in this color for a long time. I love the style and fit. I have been really impressed with under armour apparel lately. The quality is steadily improving. Also having Steph Curry endorse your product is a super smart idea. Seems like a quality and great person to represent your brand.
Under Armour,6,59.95,2023-06-15,4.7,"I recently purchased my third pair of this shoe and I have yet to be disappointed. I was a bit concerned when I ordered the new pair because it is an updated style, but my concerns were put to rest as soon as I put them on. Exactly like the previous version. I appreciate this a lot because both myself and my wife have liked a shoe only to see an update to the style making it not fit the same or as comfortable. I will be going back to Under Armour for my sneakers for a very long time. Also, their prices are fantastic!"
Under Armour,6,59.95,2023-01-07,4.7,"This is the third pair of these shoes with different colors that I've bought. I love the way they look. I bought size 9 1/2 (US) the first pair, and they were a tad short (toe came to the very end of shoes). I ordered size 10 the second pair, and they fit perfectly. So I ordered size 10 again on the third pair, and they fit exactly like the first pair that were size 9 1/2. I could tell they fit diffetent than my size tens, but I had worn them a few hours or I would have sent them back."
Under Armour,6,59.95,2023-04-19,4.7,These shoes are awesome. I use them for Pickleball. They are extremely comfortable and provide excellent support. They grip the court surface well. The soles hold up well. This is the 11th pair I’ve purchased. And all 11 are still in the rotation. I normally wear a 10.5 but always get size 11 and they fit perfectly.
Under Armour,6,59.95,2023-07-05,4.7,"I usually have good luck with UA shoes., These haven't held up very well. The sole kind of pops sometimes like it's blowed out or something. The loop on the back of the shoes is unraveling. Disappointed in this purchase. I can't take them back because it's past the return period."
Under Armour,6,59.95,2022-07-02,4.7,These shoes are amazing and comfortable. I would definitely recommend buying them. Very well made and worth the price. My husband lover them. The design on the bottom is very nice. Color is vibrant and looks great with anything.
Under Armour,6,59.95,2022-10-15,4.7,"I ordered this particular shoe along with another pair because I loved the color combination, however, it does not fit true to size. I wear and ordered a size 15 and I must say it felt like I was attempting to squeeze my foot into a size 12 or 13 shoe. Whomever is manufacturing the shoes needs to make adjustments to the size."
Under Armour,6,59.95,2023-05-07,4.7,"I do alot of walking & running and these are extremely comfortable. I did not have to break these in, and was able to wear them immediately and walked several miles that day. Good quality for the money."
Under Armour,6,59.95,2022-06-30,4.7,"I this is my second pair of running shoes by UA. I don't just run in them, I do some long distance walking and they protect my feet really well. They look great and my feet don't sweat in humid 90 degree weather. Definitely a loyal customer now."
Under Armour,6,59.95,2023-02-06,4.7,"When I need shoes, I always wait for the Under Armour page and so far I have not been disappointed. It’s got to the point where I even buy my Daughters training shoes from UA! Sometimes it embarrassing to go out as I have T-shirts, trainers plus my U.A hat. I’ve been asked if I worked for UnderArmour to which I answer “ I wish I did”"
Under Armour,6,59.95,2022-10-15,4.7,"I ordered these shoes along with another pair. The other pair fit perfectly, however, trying this shoe on felt like I was squeezing my size 15 foot into a size 12 shoe. Under Armour needs to let the manufacturer know their measurements are way off and make adjustments ASAP!"
Under Armour,7,64.99,2023-06-24,4.6,"I loved the appearance of these shoes but never was able to wear them. Based on reviews saying the fit was small, I ordered a half-size larger than I normally wear. For the last 40 years, my shoe size was an 8. Once in a while I was forced into an 8 1/2. This was consistently the case. So I ordered a size 8 1/2 in these shoes. They had the tightest and most painful fit of any shoes I have ever put on my feet. The size 8 1/2 shoe was ridiculously small. On the website, I was told I could exchange them only for a black pair. The shoes I ordered were white with orange trim. Fully black was totally unacceptable. I returned them to a local Under Armour Outlet store for a refund. I still don't understand how the company can peddle the shoes being so undersized.

Under Armour,7,64.99,2023-12-01,4.6,"As soon as I received the shoes, I took them for a 10K run. Here is what happened:\nI have wide feet, so initially I got these in a size bigger than my typical shoe size. They fit perfectly. Very snug, my feet didn’t slip inside the shoe. The foam is quite comfortable for the price point. The shoe also has a grip on the road, I didn’t slip running through mud or wet asphalt. I did get a blister on my Achilles Area, probably shouldn’t have worn ankle socks. \nBut I enjoyed running in these shoes, and loved the sound of them beating on the asphalt, going “koob koob koob koob”. \nOverall this is a great show for the price. I was a little hesitant with UA, but the charged assert 10 has delivered. Will return to review again once I wear them out."
Under Armour,7,64.99,2024-02-25,4.6,"Quality:overall, feels goodAppearance:Nice design, but some imperfections on the pair receivedPerformance:comfortableThis is my 2nd purchase from the seller. I ordered on 28 Jan and received on 31 Jan. The shoes fit true to size. They are comfortable to wear and walk in.Some minor imperfections:1. There are some faint scratches or stains on the left toe cap. Hope I can remove them with sneaker cleaner.2. The front tip of the right sole does not appear to be cut in the correct shape.So, I will take away one star for these. Otherwise, I think they are OK and do not affect the overall comfort and performance of the shoes."
Under Armour,7,64.99,2024-03-11,4.6,"The Assert 10 shoe arrived earlier than scheduled. It was nicely packaged. The shoe initially felt stiff, but it has a nice & comfortable arch support when worn. I ordered my typical size for underarmour shoes, but this model seems a liitle snug. A half size larger would have been better fit. Its a good looking shoe, However, not quite as pictured; namely color discrepancies ... body of shoe has lighter gray than expected and white soles rather than gray."
Under Armour,7,64.99,2023-05-24,4.6,"Based on the reviews a out running small from the previous model, UA Charged Assert 9, I ordered this Charged Assert 10 a half size larger than normal for me. My toes are hitting the end of the shoe and I don’t think ordering a full size larger than normal, 11 vs 10, would provide enough room in length. Too bad because otherwise it is a great looking shoe that otherwise appears to fit well. I can’t recommend due thevsizing issue. Bottom line, order up one size (at least) and I am returning. UA needs to correct this shoe’s sizing issues."
Under Armour,7,64.99,2023-08-14,4.6,"cant say it was UA' s fault, but my shoes were delivered 3 days later than FedEx promised. No big deal I guess not like I needed them for a special occasion, still..... The shoes themselves are nice looking but i was a little disappointed in the whiteness of the shoes. The picture I saw on the website seemed not to be so white, afraid it is going to be a little hard to keep them that white. Performance wise, i havent really worn them yet but the rim of the shoe where the bottom of your ankle is, is padded nicely. Overall I like the shoes and will just keep a wet rag and a little soap in a ziplock with me!"
Under Armour,7,64.99,2023-12-16,4.6,"I officiate football and wanted to try another brand of sneakers for next season so I purchased this model during the outstanding Black Friday sale. I have never owned Under Armour sneakers before but have gotten positive recommendations from fellow umpires who have been wearing them and I also notice top level officials wearing the brand. Although I haven't worn these shoes in game action yet, these seem comfortable in wearing them around. I am optimistic that these shoes will be comfortable during games next season"
Under Armour,7,64.99,2023-06-17,4.6,"I need extra wide (4E) fit and have only found a couple shoes that do the job and one discontinued recently. I tried on 4 other brands before I found these gems (my last chance). They felt a little short in the store however I took them home anyways and wore them a little to try them out. I could of lived with them but when I tried 1/2 size larger (10 to 10 1/2) wow I had the right fit!What people mean by 'old man shoes""? Some feet run wide. That is not cool to say that."
Under Armour,7,64.99,2023-08-10,4.6,I purchased the grey and white shoes thinking they looked Grey all around with white and then grey at the bottoms again. The photo is very deceiving in this manner making white look grey. Also the photos make it look like a more athletic shoe and that is not the case. They are much bulkier than I would’ve thought from the pictures as well. Great shoe and does what I need it too but just not what I wanted looks wise at all.
Under Armour,7,64.99,2024-01-12,4.6,My husband is 6’9” with a size 15 shoe. So shoe shopping for him can be a pain. Finding these in his size with an extra wide option was amazing. He’s worn them almost every day since Christmas. He reports they are super comfy and supportive. 0 complaints at this time. They are also really sharp looking and match most outfits.
Skechers,8,94.99,2024-03-02,4.6,"Skechers slip on shoes are awesome !. as someone with back issues it makes putting on shoes a breeze. and as with all Skechers shoes, they are super comfortable. I use these for outdoor use, in my shop, and it is very convenient to have slips on when coming in and out of the house frequently. Also, Skechers shoes are always comfortable right out of the box !! Highly recommended"
Skechers,8,94.99,2023-08-18,4.6,"I haven't had these long but I'm a fan of Skechers so I'm sure they will be good. The right shoe is a little loose (something I haven't experienced with Skechers before) so I think the back of the shoe may wear out prematurely. When I first tried them on I couldn't ""slip in"" to the left shoe. Since then it has loosened up a bit. It's great to have slip-in shoes, however, it would be nice to have laces to tighten them."
Skechers,8,94.99,2024-04-01,4.6,"I bought this a few weeks ago and soon after bought more in other colors. They are padded, but not so padded that they are overly cushey which i prefer. I also like the look/style. I was also happy that they came in extra wide."
Skechers,8,94.99,2024-03-04,4.6,"Have been wearing these daily for almost a year, including miles of walking in Britain for a month. Still super comfortable, and showing little signs of wear. Got another trip to Iceland coming up in August and I'll be buying a new pair for that."
Skechers,8,94.99,2023-05-22,4.6,These slip on sketchers are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. I recently had two hip replacements so not having to bend down is a blessing. The only negative thing I have is that shipping took way too long.
Skechers,8,94.99,2024-02-25,4.6,I got these for my husband. They were extra wide. He usually just wears a wide. He complained that they were too tight. So I had to return them .
Skechers,8,94.99,2023-11-04,4.6,easy to put on and off. Durable Washable. High quality materials. Walking made easy
Skechers,8,94.99,2023-09-08,4.6,I had to send them back as they were far too small even though I carefully measurerd in accordance with the order instructions. In 81 years I have never had such difficulty in trying on new shoes!
Skechers,8,94.99,2023-11-27,4.6,"These are very good for comfort and putting on and off. I had to go up one size,from 10 to ten and a half. This is my first time to increase size otherwise all good."
Skechers,8,94.99,2023-05-03,4.6,Will be using for everyday walking. As a senior (75+) the slip-in is a great solution for this style of shoe.
Skechers,10,64.95,2022-05-08,4.6,"I bought a pair of these from Amazon a while back. I own some Sketchers stock because it seems like a good value to me, but it's a plus if I also like the product so I wanted to try them out.They fit well and I like them overall, and they are cheaper than Rockports which I used to buy which do not seem to me to be superior.Then the other day I saw a podiatrist about my feet. She checked them out and didn't feel I needed custom inserts but recommended Walk-Hero inserts for my shoes. I brought in the Sketchers as well as a pair of Hokas which some friends recommended for foot problems. The podiatrist said both shoes were fine for me.

I also have a pair of laceless Sketchers After Burns that I think are basically identical to the lace up ones. Those were harder to yank the inserts out of- some of the foam stuck to the shoe and I had to kind of scrape it off with a knife. They should work OK, I haven't tried them with the Walk-Heros yet since I'm waiting on a couple more pairs of inserts.I am sold enough on these Sketchers I plan to buy another pair, but they appear to be out of stock both at Walmart and Amazon. (some sizes do seem to be available but not mine) It's the Covid supply chain crisis I guess. Once they are available I'll probably buy a pair from Walmart. I prefer to buy from Walmart instead of Amazon when I can get the same thing at close to the same price. The Walk-Hero inserts I got at Amazon because Walmart does carry them but the price is quite a bit more. Less"
Skechers,10,64.95,2023-09-27,4.6,"I bought three pairs of the Skecher Haniger running shoes when they were on sale as I have problems finding shoes that fit my duck like feet.When I got the latest pair out of the box, I realized they were different than that previous pairs; I double-checked the box and realized it had been mislabeled or someone put the wrong shoes in (my fault for not checking all the boxes).They're notably boxier than the Hanigers, but I figured I'd survive. So the first time I tied the shoes, the second loop from the top simply ripped off and I can't wear them as itfeels like they're about to fall off so now I have to find a shoe repair place that can fix them. Not thrilled."
Skechers,10,64.95,2023-08-21,4.6,"This is the 4th pair of these shoes I've owned. This is the first pair that will have to be replaced after such a short time span. Starting at the toe to about halfway back, the sole suddenly came off. After inspecting the left shoe it appears it will soon happen with the left shoe. The shoes have never been wet and have had pretty normal use, so I'm very surprised at how dramatic this failure has been. The sole and upper are in great shape, so it might be repairable. Still a major disappointment."
Skechers,10,64.95,2022-09-09,4.6,I bought the first pair of these sneakers for my husband several years ago and he loved them...so much so that I buy him a new pair every year. The support and comfort they provide has seen him through double shifts when he was continually on his feet. Finding comfortable sneakers that he likes had always been a nearly impossible task since he has back and foot issues. That is no longer a problem. I get these in his normal size 10.5 wide and he's happy. Give him anything other than the After Burn and it just doesn't meet with his approval. He's still got every pair I've given him and he still wears them all. The oldest pair has become his working around the house pair and the others are worn depending on color.

Skechers,10,64.95,2023-11-23,4.6,"These shoes are extremely comfortable and i really like them. They have replaced my other sneakers which bit the dust some time back. I recommend them highly.A word of caution......Skechers footwear sizing varies wildly between various models of shoes. For instance, I normally wear size 11 1/2. These sneakers are size 11; the pair of Skechers boots I purchased at about the same time are size 12. In my opinion, it is more prudent to buy them in the store where they can be tried on instead of mail order."
Skechers,10,64.95,2023-11-22,4.6,"Love these shoes! The insoles are extremely comfortable, yet a bit tight on my toes. I bought a size 10-1/2 EW - because my store didn't have them in 11W. Thinking they would stretch out some over time.?. I got lucky and found a pair of 11W at another location close to home and purchased them online. I gave the 10-1/2's to my nephew, so it's a win-win regardless, and got both pairs at a clearance marked down price!!Regular Price $59.99Clearance Sale $34.97 ea.Plus 5% Discount w/Academy CardDave R."
Skechers,10,64.95,2022-12-31,4.6,"Been buying these shoes, usally 1 or 2 pairs a year, for the last 7 or 8 years, as they are almost the only thing I wear. Always the same fit right out of the box, 11 1/2 Extra Wide. Bought a pair on line and picked up in store back in July. Tried on about a week after buying them, seemed kind of tight in the toe box, but checked the box and shoe and both said they were the right size. Put them in the closet and did not pull them out till right before Christmas, with the same tight fit. I wear a couple of older pairs everyday, and have come to the conclusion that the new shoes were mislabeled, definately not extra wide, and probably more like an 10 1/2 or 11 medium. Just a heads up, try them on in a timely manner. Guess I learned a little lesson about my favorite shoes."
Skechers,10,64.95,2023-09-16,4.6,"When I went tto Academy to buy this pair of shoes. There was no doubt that this was the shoe that. I wanted. I bought a pair about 4 years ago, and I wore the heck out of them. I trashed them, on one the sole was over half falling off.. but if I hadn't found the same kind of shoes I might have left empty handed. My old pair was black and the new pair is gray and brown. Other than that they're the same. When I left the store I was ecstatic that I had found the same kind of shoes."
Skechers,10,64.95,2023-04-29,4.6,"I bought these at the same tie as a pair Skechers hiking shoes, intending to wear both in a 10-day trip to Ireland. I wore them a total of about 9 days over the course of three weeks before-hand to give them a chance to break-in and the memory soles to form, but that just didn't happen I couldn't wear them on the 10-hour flight over and gave up after the first day of walking and hours on the bus. They felt great while I was walking, but if I stood in one place for too long or sat on a bus for more than about an hour, I could feel my toes going to sleep. I ended up wearing the other pair the rest of the trip, including on the plane back to Texas, thankful that I never had to put these on again because the others got too wet."
Skechers,10,64.95,2023-12-11,4.6,"I love the idea of no shoelaces as mine are always coming undone. I wanted a pair of sliip ins that looked like a normal running shoe, and these look pretty good. However, after a week of wearing them, they fit differently. It seems like they are always loose. I think it's just a matter of me getting used to the different feel but we'll see. I do love the fact that there are no shoelaces, fantastic. We'll see if I can adjust to the feel."

Skechers,11,68.0,2024-02-03,4.6,My husband works as a parts driver and also customer service. He will be 65 this year. He started with more of a work boot and compared these shoes with “ they feel light as a feather”. They also brush off well as he delivers to some muddy garages. Can’t wait for them to go on sale again and I’ll grab him a backup pair. No laces either to deal with. He slips them on and the laces are kind of bungee material and snug onto your feet.

The show itself feels a little wide in the toes with odd arch support placement. The non-slip is perfect and the outer material has so far kept minor spills from seeping inside the inner shoe. I am likely going to purchase a third-party insert, as the provided memory foam lacks sufficient comfort when working an 8 hour shift."

I’ve been having trouble with my shoes because I’ve recently gotten gout, that has left my foot continuously sore for some reason. These shoes have been incredibly comfortable . I’ve had them for less than a week and have had little issues with my feet. The shoes are snug but very stretchable. Super happy with them!!"
Skechers,11,68.0,2021-03-23,4.6,"I bought this shoe because my old shoes were raggedy and falling apart. I am very picky about shoes because I am a Type-I Diabetic, and also drive a manual transmission vehicle. For me, the shoe has to be solid enough to avoid any injuries to my feet, but also breathable enough to ensure proper moisture wicking. It also needs to be narrow and flexible enough to press a clutch pedal in a smaller vehicle. This shoe, while a little bit expensive, checks all of those boxes. It is comfortable to wear and is very light, with good tread. It drains water well, so well in fact that they dried about as fast as boating shoes after being submerged in river water while kayaking and seem no worse for wear."
Skechers,11,68.0,2020-08-24,4.6,"Terrible shoes. I am a Hospitality manager, constantly running around the restaurant and kitchen. These shoes make my feet feel worse that any other pair of work shoes I have owned. I have purchased expensive skechers work shoes before was pleased but these are awful. I should have guessed they would be bad shoes since they cost half of what other skechers work shoes cost. Yes are no slip but that is it for benefits. They dont breathe and they started falling apart day 1.Wish i had not bought them for myself and staff. Skechers quality has deteriorated in the last few years. They used to be great shows and lasted a long time. Not any more!!!Trefsafe are a better option and a better price!"
Skechers,11,68.0,2019-10-02,4.6,"Lightweight, breathable, heel support, slip resistant and affordable. Feels like a sneaker which is fantastic when you spend hours on your feet baking. The shoe was recommended for my needs by a professional and highly knowledgeable Manager at the Town Center location, Vicki. They did not have the shoe but she placed in on hold for me at another location and I went and picked it up with ease. Vicki had two sizes waiting for me to try on at the other location. She took the time to size me, and she knew I would need to see which felt and fit better.

Skechers,12,39.99,2024-02-12,4.5,"When I first opened the box to try on these sneakers, there was a heavy chemical smell from the insoles. I dismissed the smell believing it would disipate once removed from the box. Well, after 2 days the smell has not decreased & is extremely irritating. Since I can't return them after wearing for 2 days I decided to put tyhem in the washer. I amstill noticing the chemical spell. I have another exact pair and there has never been an issue with an odor. I really like the fit and comfort of these sneakers. So I will continue to wear my other pair and try more cleaning of this recent purchase."
Skechers,12,39.99,2023-05-09,4.5,"These shoes are great for everyday use. I use mine for everything, especially daily walks. These are my second pair. The first pair are at least a year old and still in pretty good shape. I bought these just as a backup pair for when the old ones eventually wear out. Granted the shoe isn't as styling as an Under Armour pair I own, but they are way more comfortable. To me, comfort beats style."
Skechers,12,39.99,2023-05-15,4.5,"Very lightweight sneaker while being comfortable to be in all working day (8 hours). I also like they are machine washable to. Great price point. Obviously these aren’t Nike or Jordan’s but these are my working shoes, not going out shoes so they serve their purpose well."
Skechers,12,39.99,2024-02-14,4.5,"The brand and quality of the product is good. Unfortunately, I cannot wear them because it's too big for my size. I need a size 9 only. I want it replace as soon as possible. How can I return and exchange it? Pls help."
Skechers,12,39.99,2024-03-31,4.5,These feel amazing. They are very comfortable and lightweight. They seem almost too light. They feel more like slippers than shoes.
Skechers,12,39.99,2024-03-13,4.5,Extremely comfortable for walking. Skechers make the best sneakers. The memory foam inside the sneaker give you great cushioning.
Skechers,12,39.99,2023-04-18,4.5,Very light weight and stylish! Taking them on a European walking vacation. Excellent Target price$...yeah!
Skechers,12,39.99,2024-04-02,4.5,"Comfortable, quality sneaks at great price. What's not to like?"
Skechers,12,39.99,2024-04-18,4.5,"Got these Shoes for walking, Nice & Comfy, at a great price!"
Skechers,12,39.99,2023-11-22,4.5,Nice comfy attractive shoe
Skechers,13,90.0,2024-03-05,4.8,"Material:PU LeatherComfortability:Seriously comfortable!I’m a US 9.5, UK 8.5 and Euro 43 with 27.5 cm. Since I couldn’t get this size, I opt for US 10, UK 9 since Euro size remains 43 with 28 cm. To my surprise, the size the shoes is seriously bigger than I expected. But it’s okay since I have a wide feet. For those who plan to buy the shoes, do check your sizes properly. On the other hand, I enjoy the experience using this shoes as it is lightweight and totally comfortable on my feet."
Skechers,13,90.0,2023-09-23,4.8,"I suffer from back problems and wanted shoes that would not agitate this whilst putting on. I also wanted comfort and cushioning to make mobility more comfortable. These shoes are perfect for all my needs including both formal and casual wear.I must say that apart from this, the shoe horn type design works perfectly for putting shoes on without any use of hands. No need to tie laces either as they are fixed."
Skechers,13,90.0,2024-01-16,4.8,"My husband has the sketcher trainer style slip-ins and loves them for comfort and ease so he thought he'd order the shoes. Same size was ordered but because of the stiffness, the leather and style he was unable to slip-in and had to pull on with finger. He felt next size up would be too large.Nice style but he couldn't slip his foot in with this style of shoe.. and that was the purpose he wanted them as his job involves entering people's houses and taking off shoes."
Skechers,13,90.0,2023-09-06,4.8,"I have Peripheral Neuropathy which makes putting footwear on, very difficult, if not very frustrating. The advent of the Sketcher Slip-In has changed everything from a chore to a simple standing-Walk In. The security of the construction of these shoes has helped remove frustration and simply allows my energy to beused much more productively. Give them a try! You'll be surprised!"
Skechers,13,90.0,2024-01-02,4.8,"We bought these shoes as a gift for my husband’s 96-year old father who has trouble putting shoes on unassisted. He told us these are the first pair of shoes he has put in that felt comfortable from the first minute! He says they fit like a dream and he loves them. We love that they are leather, don’t need to be tied, have traction like athletic shoes but look like dress shoes. These are amazing!"
Skechers,13,90.0,2024-01-05,4.8,"Bought last week. Nice shoe, great fit, but it has a design flaw that rubs the mid foot. DSW did not allow exchange for different shoe that was exact same cost and brand. They required me to pay shipping even though all I wanted to do was exchange for equal value shoe. I had to return. Will not buy from DSW again"
Skechers,13,90.0,2024-02-03,4.8,"I wanted a shoe which was light weight, slip on and provided arch support, but am now at an age where something which looks like a training shoe is a little too “young” for a man of my age.This was a perfect compromise. Looks like a shoe, but wears like a trainer. Good quality and fair price. Happy customer here."
Skechers,13,90.0,2023-12-01,4.8,"Great comfy shoes, exactly as advertised. Nice colour, good fit (a medium tight, not narrow as I feared, these are just right for me. I normally wear a shoe with a broadish toebox, these are perfect. A rather dressy sneaker, that's why they are so popular and hard to find in stock."
Skechers,13,90.0,2023-08-24,4.8,"This is my second pair of these Skechers Slip In shoes. They are both very easy to put on and take off. This pair has leather upper (or so the description said), which allows it to be worn in more ""formal"" occasions. The only complaint is the outsole is a bit wide (for my size 11 shoe), which keeps rubbing on the brake paddle when I lift off the gas while driving."
Skechers,13,90.0,2023-07-10,4.8,"I was looking for a comfortable dress shoe as I do a fair bit of walking at work. I've had issues with Morton's neuroma and plantar fasciitis. I hoped the sketchers slip in would fit the bill, and it does. I've never owned dress shoes this comfortable. They are awesome."
Puma,15,35.99,2024-02-22,3.6,"Nice looking trainers, light weight and very affordable but too narrow and tight especially in the front end, didn't realize this runs small. A size 0.5 above my regular would make a difference because I have wide feet. The strings could also be made a bit longer.

Puma,15,35.99,2024-02-17,3.6,"The previous versions of Turin and Turino were just as nice looking but this one is a huge failure because the previous versions (Turin annd Turino) all had a soft foam cushioned sole which made the shoe very comfortable. This one does not and is uncomfortable to wear. Unfortunately, I have no choice but to return the shoes."
Puma,15,35.99,2024-04-24,3.6,"On the narrower side for Puma shoes, but not unexpected given that many Puma shoes run on the narrow side. Slightly more snug than similar sized Pumas, so potentially consider ordering half a size larger.Good value and look nice, though the materials are not as nice as more expensive Pumas."
Puma,15,35.99,2024-02-20,3.6,"The shoes are nice looking just like previous versions but for some strange reason they took out the comfortable padded soles and so shoes are very uncomfortable to wear. They would be great with that same sole as before, why change a good thing? I don’t get it"
Puma,15,35.99,2024-04-24,3.6,"Excellent shoe. However, it fits on the small, narrow side. IUsually an 8.5 fits well. This 8.5 is narrow and just enough room at the toe. Size 9 would’ve been much better."
Puma,15,35.99,2024-04-24,3.6,"When I got the package, it was already torn and a yellow stain on the shoes. I cleaned them as much as I could and it is really the worst service. . It is a terrible service.You have to verify before sending the product to customers."
Puma,15,35.99,2024-04-13,3.6,The purchase process was very good. The shoes run small and narrow. They are not comfortable. I returned the first pair for a larger size and still are not comfortable.
Puma,15,35.99,2024-02-12,3.6,I wear a 91/2 10 in women and bought the 10 because they are narrow and they fit perfect. The sneakers are very comfortable and i wear them to work in the office every week . I bought the navy blue and the all black. Very neat on the feet

Puma,18,32.5,2023-10-08,4.4,"I just received these and will be returning. The first problem is the packaging was in absolute shambles. I’ve never gotten shoes delivered from a name brand company, in such a raggedy condition. The plastic bag they came in was sloppily taped all over. When I finally got through the tape to take the box out, the box just fell open. This was a CLEAR sign that everyone else in these comments who said these shoes aren’t wide had had the exact same pair already, and Puma couldn’t be bothered to change out the packaging. Which leads me to my second problem. These shoes are simply not wide and they shouldn’t be advertised as such."
Puma,18,32.5,2023-11-12,4.4,"bought for use playing tennis and this shoe is brand new for me....i.e. never used before. Have playedd twice and find it very comfortable on hard service courts. I like the ""width"" feeling....i.e. the shoe gives support going side to side since it does not tend to ""roll"" when you do that on the court. Its grip on the surface is firm and comfortable. Shoe use is too new to determine how it will slid but so far it is very good since my mind no longer thinks of it as ""new, so be creful"" which is unusual for only having played with it twice. Net, overall, very good w/o any know restrictions to date."
Puma,18,32.5,2023-12-20,4.4,"I really like the VIz Runner Repeat Men's Running shoes, however they are not really good for jogging. I am keeping them because the are comfortable for walking in and look good when I wear a black pair of jeans.The reason for the 1star is the credit card I used got HACKED, and the card had not been used for at least 3 months. I received notification from my bank for two online purchases totaling $620. soon after. Your company was the only online transaction that I had made and it seemed perplexing to me that soon after that purchase, someone tried to do a online transaction with my card number and security code. Just saying."
Puma,18,32.5,2023-12-31,4.4,"They arrived today and I was excited to open them. Immediately my mind said ‘these are absolutely not wide’ which I had ordered. 11.5W the sticker in the shoe says ‘XL’ nothing about wide which I wanted.So I try them on and they are narrow fitting. Darn it!If you order a ‘wide’ pair, know that you won’t receive it.I’ve ordered from a few places online and I swear this online ordering is nothing but a clearing house for their ‘sloppy seconds’ or something. I will try them about the house for a few days but I suspect back they will go, sadly."
Puma,18,32.5,2023-11-04,4.4,"As I said in my previous review, this was the second pair of Puma's, that I now have purchased and added to my shoe collection. Just like the first pair, I once again seen these on a ad and when I seen the neon orange on these shoes and knew just how comfortable and how perfect the first pair felt, this was a no brainier of a purchase. These shoes rock, the orange just pops and they are comfortable as hell! For the price and what this shoe offers as far as comfort and style, the decision to buy these did take long at all. I was on it! Puma, once again, thank you for the amazing shoes, I'm proud to wear them!"
Puma,18,32.5,2024-02-07,4.4,I have worn puma shoes since 1972 when I played sports in high school and college.I set school records that still stand today. I've always hadPuma shoes throughout my adult life the comfort has always beenbeen excellent. The new ones that I purchased don't haveThe same comfort as my old ones. They feel like something isMissing in the front sole part of the shoe making walking unbalanced.
Puma,18,32.5,2024-04-18,4.4,"These are the First pumas I've ever owened. I actually bought them for my work. I'm a house painter.And go through many cheap shoes every year. And they all hurt my feet.So I decided to get a better, more comfortable shoe. The Pumas were not expensive.And mostly leather. So now I have a new work shoe. They are so comfortable, and soWell made. There GREAT! The only problem is I don't want to get tPAINT on them. Lol. But I'm so Happy to finally be comfortable !I think I'll buy another pair, not for work."
Puma,18,32.5,2023-12-19,4.4,I bought these to replace another Puma running shoe taht I had for 2 years and finally wore out. I use these shoes not for running but for walking about 6 miles every day. They are great for walking and they are very comfortable. I have to admit that I do add Arch support padding because I have fallen Arches but this is no fault to this shoe it just a condition that runs in my family. I do Love Puma shoes and have been buying them for more than a decade. I like them much more than Nike which are very over priced. I wish Puma would make a Golf shoe as I would try them.
Puma,19,67.5,2024-03-11,4.5,"got a sales ad, like I do a few times a year. Chose two pairs, got 40% off, got free shipping and got my shoes in a few days.Fit great, although I have found that Puma run slightly smaller than other shoes, so I usually order half a size larger, loveboth pairs!"
Puma,19,67.5,2024-04-05,4.5,Bought this shoe recently and am impressed! I am a former runner who walks almost daily. The cushioning is impressive.At current price you cannot go wrong!
Puma,19,67.5,2024-04-06,4.5,Just ran 5 miles in these in a hilly trained trail and the lightweight and cushion was pretty solid with two pairs of socks on
Adidas,20,69.99,2023-04-24,4.7,"Good trainers, I bought a pair of size 10s and I really liked them but thought they might be a bit loose for a slip on and wondered if I should go a size down. After a day or so I decided they were perfect as is. Anyway I went to buy another pair of these and they were sold out but I’d check back every so often as I really wanted another pair and as luck would have it a pair of size 10s showed up and I brought. Funny enough a pair of size 9 1/2 were delivered so I got to see which pair was best. While the size 9 1/2 do fit me the 10 I have fit better for sure, so stick to your usual size. The trainer is comfortable, I like the slip on aspect, I do think they may wear down fairly quickly on the sole and perhaps that is reflected in the price. Anyway I love them"
Adidas,20,69.99,2023-05-28,4.7,"It’s very hard for me to shop for shoes because I have very wide feet, so I usually don’t bother. These shoes have very wide sizes though, which was a pleasant surprise. They fit very secure on the ankles but not to tight on my wide feet, which makes them great for running. Would high recommend these shoe to anyone especially if you have wide feet and are lookin for a great slide on running shoe."
Adidas,20,69.99,2024-02-20,4.7,"These shoes are tight at the ankle, near the front of the hole at the top of the shoe. I ordered wide shoes, but don't know if I received a wide pair, since while I found the size on the shoe, there was nothing indicating it was a wide shoe. I bought them on clearance, so I am wearing them and hoping they stretch out and become more comfortable. That's the risk you take buying online instead of going to a shoe store."
Adidas,20,69.99,2023-06-05,4.7,"I bought two pairs. At first they were convenient and looked great for work. After 3 months or so of wearing them, they started to break down. Arch support was so bad I started having foot pain in my left foot. I'm giving them to charity as soon as I find replacements with better arch support. Great style but they'll ruin your feet."
Adidas,20,69.99,2023-06-06,4.7,"I've had 3 pairs of these, and I am sure I will have another pair. They are the best slip-on athletic shoe I've found.I use them for walking and weekend use. Super comfortable, although I did change the insole to something that fits my foot better. The only downside I've encountered is that the soles seem to wear out too quickly."
Adidas,20,69.99,2023-10-27,4.7,"My husband bought a pair of these and just loves them. He wears them a lot. So, I bought him a 2nd pair of the same ones for when the other ones wear out. He says they are very comfortable. They do look nice for going out. Dressier than a regular sneaker."
Adidas,20,69.99,2024-03-04,4.7,"Bought these for my boyfriend a couple weeks ago. He loves this style shoe - he wore out the first pair over a few years and had to have the same ones! He wears them for everything - casual day to day, at the gym, even Colorado hiking. He says they're comfortable and durable."
Adidas,20,69.99,2024-03-05,4.7,Soo happy with these sneakers! They were are great find at a great price!Super lightweight and extremely comfortable! l am lucky enough to be able to wear sneakers for work and these are in my lineup now! They are easy to slide on and off and the color combination gets noticed all the time!
Adidas,20,69.99,2023-05-19,4.7,This is the second pair of these shoes that I have purchased for my son. He absolutely loves these comfortable slip on men's sneakers! We got a second pair so that we could have them when the first pair wears out. He loves them that much! ...A man with a back-up plan!
Adidas,20,69.99,2024-02-06,4.7,"These feel great once you get them on. I really had to force them on. They're comfortable, but not as comfortable as my Pumas. They have that unique Adidas design that is very attractive but and I love the look. I suppose they'll get easier to slip on over time."
Adidas,21,90.0,2023-12-28,4.6,"If you have large or wide feet beware this brand of sneaker. Abstractly the shoe was wide enough but the hole at the top is tiny, so tiny I couldn't get my foot in it. It's solid without much stretch and wasn't the type where you could unlace it to have more room. Rather defeats the purpose of offering large and wide sizes! If you have wide feet, I would not take a chance on this shoe if I were you."
Adidas,21,90.0,2023-10-03,4.6,"Even though I am unable to run, the shoes make me feel like I can, the feel is 'snug' like a mold made just for my foot plus the shoe lace system is easy for me to use. During my long and active work life, I had need for many different styles of shoe, and those needs were filled nicely by Hubbard, but how I wished for a casual shoe that I could wear all day at home (too old and bent up for picnics) or so I thought until I bought this shoe. And... the price was an equally pleasant surprise. Thank You!"
Adidas,21,90.0,2023-11-12,4.6,"I have had these sneakers for two weeks now and I am impressed with how comfortable they are. I wear them to work which is on my feet all day and when my shift is over, my feet are not hurting which is usually not the case. I have received lots of compliments on how stylish they are. I am very happy I bought this pair!"
Adidas,21,90.0,2023-07-14,4.6,I am a women’s sized 9.5-10 and I bought men’s shoes because of the wide toe base. The look nice but aren’t very comfortable. I wore them to Disneyland and in about 7 hours my feet were killing me! I think these are more street shoes. More for looks.
Adidas,21,90.0,2024-01-17,4.6,Very comfortable! Glad it comes in a wide size which is hard to find for sneakers with good design. I bought this as a gift to my friend’s son who wears an insert for his flat feet. He loves it and wears it every day in school. Highly recommend.
Adidas,21,90.0,2023-12-26,4.6,Great shoe to wear to the office. Neutral color. Comfortable font and lots of cushion.
Adidas,21,90.0,2024-04-01,4.6,"I wore this two times previously, once while driving & the other Walking. Today I went for a walk & the right side wall of the left shoe is now pressing into my foot.... It went from an ok shoe to extremely uncomfortable, & now I'm throwing it into the garbage. I live in Canada, so even if this was returnable I'm not driving back for a return"
Adidas,21,90.0,2024-03-16,4.6,"I ordered these online. Based on the picture, they appeared to be black and white uppers, with the sole fading from blue up to light blue. When they arrived, they are only black and white with the sole fading from white up to black. Bummer."
Adidas,21,90.0,2023-09-05,4.6,"I bought these shoes for my husband who is on. His feet all day for work. Very comfortable shoe and would have worked out perfectly. , I am not sure why all the Adidas now only come in WIDTH size. For that reason, I will have to return them."
Adidas,21,90.0,2024-04-23,4.6,Just got these shoes last week. The quality is extraordinary and they fit true to the size. The design is quite attractive since the color combination seems to evoke time in the US Armed Forces which l particularly love.

Adidas,22,74.95,2024-01-05,4.8,"Ordered for self and spouse 2 types of sneakers and while they are comfortable, there is little support - o can nearly feel the floor. My main issue that white are not actual leather and the feel is plastic-ish. Suede (green) stated that it’s leather or real suede, yet compared to other adidas shoes, it feels contrary to the label. Mine had uneven toe details. Bottom line: just ok. It’s not worth the discount."
Adidas,22,74.95,2024-04-19,4.8,"This is a verycomfortable and stylish shoe. I even got some compliments on it while wearing it to work. It’s retro, minimalist design is great. However, the description says it has a leather upper, but the tag on the shoe clearly says it’s synthetic man-made which is very misleading. For whatever reason Adidas shoes are mislabeled on the Nordstrom Rack website, perhaps they used to be leather and now they no longer are?"
Adidas,22,74.95,2023-10-31,4.8,"I bought these as I was looking for a Sambas style shoe at a cheaper price point. Adidas usually runs large on me but I found this to be true to size, and actually a little on the snug side. These aren’t the most comfortable sneaker so far - I’ve found my toes feel a little sore due to lack of support. I’m hoping they will get more comfortable and/or I just won’t use them when I’ll be walking too much. Overall a decent alternative although I wouldn’t pay full price."
Adidas,22,74.95,2024-04-14,4.8,My husband loves these new shoes. He wears them pretty much everywhere. Myer had a super sale on. I was able to purchase these shoes and a different Adidas pair for my son. Two great purchases. Thanks!

Adidas,23,167.0,2024-03-13,4.7,"I love Nordstrom. Pretty much the only place I shop for fashion on-line. Today, my much anticipated Adidas Sambas arrived. I have been trying to buy these for a year but they never have my size in stock, but one day while looking, again, they had ONE - 7.5 women's black Sambas available. In my cart, $100 bucks, bam! Today I am sad, they came in a crushed, taped back together box, no shape insert, laced-up, clearly worn with animal or something hair inside both, and schmutz on the soles. They look like I could have gotten them at Goodwill. Not a consignment store, because they would have at least cleaned them up before selling them. :-("
Adidas,23,167.0,2024-02-13,4.7,"I normally wear women’s 9 and got these in 9.5 (marked on inside US 8.5, uk 8, fr42, jp 265) I got them in 9.5 because 9 was sold out. Anyway i wore them on a trip everyday for 14 days. Wore them with cotton no-show socks. They were very comfortable. No break in and no blisters. I noticed that the shoe has a very narrow toe box so even though 9 would have been better length wise, it may have squeezed my toes so the mainly walking trip may have been a more uncomfortable on my feet. I did A LOT walking in warm weather. I have other adidas in woman’s 9 (marked on the inside us 8, uk 7.5, fr 41.5, jp 260). So go figure. The sizing maybe is weird because this shoe is so narrow."
Adidas,23,167.0,2023-11-06,4.7,"I've been researching Samba OG sneakers for a minute and everywhere I've read, I was told to size up. I am normally a woman's size 10 (I am a true 10 with wide feet). In Converse, I wear (men's) size 7.5 or 8s. But for Samba OG sneakers, I ordered a woman's 10.5/men's 9.5. I just came on here to exchange for a smaller size but they're completely out of the white/halo blue/gum5 color way -- as is nearly every other store it seems -- so I'm sticking with these even though my feet look disproportionately larger than the rest of my body. Whoops! I think it is safe to play it conservative, at least in the way sizing is listed on Nordstrom's site, and go for your regular size."
Adidas,23,167.0,2024-03-14,4.7,"The sambas are back on trend, great fit. I have problems with my feet always trying to find trainers that are a bit wider. But these are great. Was very surprised at the colours available. Went for the navy and red. Leather great quality. Look fab. Usually order a 4.5 so I went with 4.5 perfect. Thinking of another colour now."
Adidas,23,167.0,2023-10-26,4.7,"I was hoping the fit in the toe box would be wider considering these shoes are labeled as “unisex.” I went up a half size to accommodate my slightly wider foot and low profile orthotics, and it helped a little, but was disappointed with the narrow almond-shaped toe. I have a pair of older Sambas that have a wider toe box, so am a little bummed that the newer models got narrower. I’m planning to use some shoe stretchers to widen the leather a bit, they should be great after that. Other than that, they’re good ole Sambas."
Adidas,23,167.0,2024-04-17,4.7,"The shoes look great! Sadly, though they don’t fit. My past experience with shoe sizing between men and women’s sizes is a 2 size difference. So, a men’s 5 would be the same as a women’s 7. If you Google it, they say it’s 1.5 size difference. Adidas says it’s only a 1 size difference, which is why they say a men’s 6 is the same as a women’s 7 but they are wrong. I ordered this size shoe and it is a full size too big. I was so excited to have found my size in stock but sadly these have to go back as they are way too big."
Adidas,23,167.0,2024-04-02,4.7,"In love with my new sambas. Really comfy although i couldve gotten away with half size smaller. Im a 5 and theres a bit of room at the top. But in saying that mightve been too squished. As an nhs worker i got 10% discount off, even better. So thank you Office, i just love your shoes and trainers, have ordered off here a few times and never disappointed. All really great materials."
Adidas,23,167.0,2024-04-21,4.7,"Comfortable, true to size, quality shoe. There are so many mixed reviews about sizing for Sambas, but they run true to size. I'm a solid 9 and originally ordered an 8.5 since many reviews say they run big, but I ended up having to return for a 9 and they fit perfectly. Orders, shipping, and returns were all easy and the process went smoothly. If you're hesitating, just order these shoes in your normal size from Hibbett!"
Adidas,23,167.0,2024-02-16,4.7,"The colors are great and the shoe feels good. Maybe stiffer leather than I expected. The only bothering thing is tying, such small holes and thick shoelace, difficult to put a finger underneath the shoelace and untie. Takes lot of time and hurts fingers.The was an extra pair shoelace in the box. I guess they get worn out quickly bcs the holes are so small."
Adidas,24,100.0,2021-12-08,4.7,I love the shell toe classics and these do not disappoint. The fact that they are made mostly of recycled materials is a huge plus for me.These shoes are true to size and have the classic shell toe arch support. The shoelaces take some getting used to since they are made from paper. I'm pretty sure that means they are made of tyvec so they will become less crisp over time.Thanks for a crisp pair of comfy shoes.
Adidas,24,100.0,2022-05-06,4.7,"Light and comfortable with excellent traction on dusty concrete. The protective shell toe is great for moderate duty, warehouse work. The roomy front, wellcushioned heel, and ample arch supportmean fresh feet at the end of the day."
Adidas,24,100.0,2023-09-05,4.7,My son really loves these shoes. He feels pumped every time he wears them. I may have to buy these shoes over and over again. I just wished they were cheaper.
Adidas,24,100.0,2021-03-28,4.7,I actually bought these to wear for a photo to go on my upcoming mixtape MY RETROSPECTIVE. I was looking for the Retro look being that I go by the Moniker R3$3Y R3Tro. They Went perfectly with this white and Black(BLECKKER & Mercer) Windbreaker and a pair of Skinny's lol. So thank you finishline your shoes will be on the cover up my mixtape!!!! And I'll be back soon!! 💪🏿
Adidas,24,100.0,2024-01-17,4.7,"One of the BEST ol' school classics ever out there! Clean colorway with the gold accents, what?! C'mon can't get any better to look classy."
Adidas,24,100.0,2023-12-08,4.7,I am a shell toe junkie. I probably buy a new pair of the same shoe 6 times a year. I just am in love with the classics. I buy them for my husband as well.
Adidas,24,100.0,2022-05-17,4.7,"These are the best tennis shoes I've had in at least 20 years. They are extremely comfortable, the laces are top quality and will not slip ... and that's about it.Bottom line, these shoes are so good, I want to buy another pair."
Adidas,24,100.0,2016-05-01,4.7,"Love these sneakers, though I had to order some fat laces online as it seems that no one carries fat laces anymore.Good retro feel. The tongue is different from the original ADDIDAS.I usually wear a size 10 in Jordans but picked up a 9.5 and they were still loose. Bought a size 9 backup that fits well. One has fat black laces the other fat white laces. Need a pair to go with the no lcae look but think I would rather have an OG pair to make that look happen."
Adidas,24,100.0,2023-08-17,4.7,Shoes fits perfectly and is very comfortable. Would definitely recommend it to persons 👍 My son can't wait for school to rock those shoes
Adidas,24,100.0,2021-12-28,4.7,They are great fitting! Universal and comfortable. They can also be a unisex wearing shoe. The color is good for all kind of fits. Black has always been my go to shoe. This shoe bring back memories from back in the 80-90

For those who have experienced a brutal, knock out divorce, how did you recover financially without killing yourself working 80 hours a week? I’ve been trying to get balanced out financially, and trying to do this in an honest way, but man, at this rate I’m never going to recover. Any suggestions would be much appreciated.

I'll place another order during a major sale, haha."
Adidas,25,64.99,2023-05-28,4.6,"I purchased these to replace a pair of grand champion court shoes, and they are stylish, but not as rigid, so more comfortable than the previous pair. Not made of leather, so not 5 stars. More for casual wear rather than use as a court shoe, but will do for the price. Purchased a mens because they seemed a bit wider than the womens. Will be playing on the court with them."
Adidas,25,64.99,2024-03-11,4.6,"I am satisifed with the product, though they are half a size larger to my liking, as these were on clearance so the options was not available. Product is as expected, comfortable for running day to day activities. The full outer leather makes these easily cleaned, the round toe gives an informal smart casual look. Adidas give me the comfort of a trustworthy quality assurance for the product I purchased."

Adidas,25,64.99,2024-01-07,4.6,"Bought as a Christmas gift for fiancé as he mentioned all his trainers were letting in water. Time for a new pair! Chose these as he likes a white trainer and his favourite colour is green and they had a really good offer on in the sale. Trainers are lovely - very stylish, comfy, durable and… they don’t let the water in!"
Adidas,25,64.99,2023-12-07,4.6,I have worn Adidas for as long as I can remember. For a while I had a problem with my heal and only could wear running shoes with good dampening. Then I bought a pair of the cloud foam series and they are almost as comfortable as a pair of running shoes. These are not quite that comfortable but still good. The only problem is that they fit a size to small (to short mostly in my case).
Adidas,25,64.99,2023-12-02,4.6,My husband loves these shoes. Said they are extremely comfortable and have significantly more support than the new Balance and Nikes. He tried. He’s gotten lots of compliments on the style. The tan soles and leather uppers make them easy to keep clean

Adidas,26,190.0,2024-04-06,4.4,"I bought these on a whim after having just returned two pairs of Nikes that were too small. I wear 11.5 usually but I guess Nike runs small. I liked how these looked and needed a new pair of road running / walking shows, so gave them a try. I bought my usual size of 11.5 and they fit perfect. They are perfectly snug but not uncomfortable. I don’t have wide or narrow feet, so I think maybe with wide feet they’d be too tight. They are super easy to take on and off without having to untie and retie (important for me as I’m lazy).They are great.

Adidas,26,190.0,2023-06-20,4.4,"After all the hype around these Adidas “Ultraboosts” that people swear by. I thought I would buy them in my size. I would never pay full price for these shoes. They are uncomfortable to wear and they were small on me and were slightly narrow. Comparing them to my New Balances these were a big disappointment for me. I have worn adidas shoes before and I have liked them but these were not it. Save your money buy something else. My new balance sneakers were only $160, better quality and feel so comfortable and they are great for long days when you are on your feet all day. Would not recommend these Ultraboosts."
Adidas,26,190.0,2023-09-24,4.4,"I purchased for my husband. Unfortunately they were too small in size but he snipped the tags so we didn't send back. He is a size 7 but they just about fit me (size 6). Reading the reviews again we ordered a size 9 and they now fit him well. So, beware they are Very Narrow Fitting indeed. Nice product otherwise."
Adidas,26,190.0,2023-03-13,4.4,"Great fit overall especially for wider feet. The lace cage does not cut into the feet like previous models. Neutral stability throughout. Cushioning is on the stiffer side which makes it great for working out. The only flaw, it needs more forefoot cushioning and padding. The forefoot is so thin you can almost feel the ground."
Adidas,26,190.0,2023-09-28,4.4,Its a light weight shoe with great comfort but it's bit tighter on the upper side and got several pealing paint on boost forms. The big issue that i see is that it's very slippery even in the light wet conditions. I don't think continental rubber grip does what it supposed to do.
Adidas,26,190.0,2023-05-28,4.4,"I'm a marathon runner and have used Ultraboost for past 5 years. This new ""light"" version delivers the amazing cushioning and support that I've come to expect from Ultraboost and they are also considerably lighter, so all the better. I'm ordering my second pair of these shoes today as I continue preparing to BQ at for Calif Int Marathon this fall."
Adidas,26,190.0,2023-12-09,4.4,"I got this shoe 2 weeks ago and I really recommend; it’s soft/plush but not too plush that you sink in to the shoe, it’s step transition is amazing, and it has a lot of upper support, my only issue is the forefoot foam stack is a bit stiff and thin but other than that it’s amazing and it makes me feel like I’m propelled foreword with every step bc of the LEP system and the rocking design."
Adidas,26,190.0,2023-12-06,4.4,True to size sneakers. The laces are terrible. My son wore these shoes 2-3 times to school and the laces broke.Replacement laces are an option but for $190 I expect a lot more. I would not buy again.
Adidas,26,190.0,2024-01-07,4.4,"Brought blind and wow I’m not disappointed most comfortable shoes I’ve owned I now own two pairs and they are always my go to. Very versatile weather it’s running, walking, golfing, casual or even basketball. I recommend everyone to buy a pair"
Adidas,26,190.0,2023-04-30,4.4,These shoes are some of the comfiest I’ve ever worn. They utilise the boost technology to provide the best cushion under your feet and fit like a glove the way they wrap around your feet. Highly recommend for an everyday jogger.

Adidas,27,89.95,2023-12-14,5.0,"TranslateShow in original languageElegante e senza tempo, posso consigliare la scarpa a chiunque, è fedele alla taglia quindi rimanete della stessa misura Grazie"
Adidas,27,89.95,2023-12-14,5.0,"TranslateShow in original languageQuesta scarpa dura super buona per il pattinaggio, ma anche è bello se si utilizza solo per il raffreddamento, raccomandare"
Adidas,27,89.95,2023-12-14,5.0,"TranslateShow in original languageCette chaussure dure super bien pour le skate mais est aussi très belle si tu l'utilises juste pour te détendre, à recommander"
Adidas,27,89.95,2023-12-14,5.0,"TranslateShow in original languageDieser Schuh hält super gut zum Skaten, sieht aber auch gut aus, wenn man ihn nur zum Chillen benutzt, empfehlenswert"
Adidas,28,152.68,2024-03-18,4.8,"the shoes came sooner than expected and have worked out great for me. they have great traction, they allowed me to stop and make quick changes in direction. they offer pretty decent ankle support as well. i have no complaints regarding them so far."
Adidas,28,152.68,2024-03-20,4.8,Feels like clouds on your feet. Materials are premium. Shoe build quality is superb. Everything you think and feel you need from an elite basketball shoe.
Adidas,28,152.68,2024-03-23,4.8,"My son loves these shoes. He had the vol. 7, and wanted these for the AAU season. They fit the same.as the vol. 7."
Adidas,28,152.68,2024-04-06,4.8,"Then this is it, one of the best shoes out right now. You’ll never make a mistake getting this one. They fit TTS and feel bouncy."
Adidas,28,152.68,2024-04-02,4.8,The shoes stand alone look average and probably even hard to match any cloth but in reality they are not bad at all. They go well with any dark cloth.
Adidas,28,152.68,2024-04-16,4.8,"Amazing Indoor sneakers! Full control, great support for foot. And gorgeous design!"
Adidas,28,152.68,2024-04-17,4.8,"The sneaker was exactly as described. Vibrant colors, great quality, sizing was good. Very happy with the shoe"
Adidas,28,152.68,2024-03-07,4.8,Shoes feel very comfortable. Shoe lining is a bit too sturdy and overall shoe is a bit heavy. Grip is very great.
Adidas,28,152.68,2024-04-17,4.8,Best Adidas shoes for basketball. The shoes do run big get half size down for that one to one fit
Adidas,28,152.68,2024-03-18,4.8,"Awesome shoe, style 10/10 , performance 8.5/10 . I would suggest to ghost down a half size but other than that I love this shoe."
Adidas,29,99.99,2024-04-19,4.5,"I have worn adidas gazelle for many years now, and have been very satisfied.However my last buy of this model was a bad experience. The materials feel cheap and low standard.After I`ve used them for walking in a city for a few days the sole was already falling off. Some bright mind decided that the outer part of the sole should just be glued around the shoe, (like a ring) this was just stupid. The ring fell off after a few days and before that all sorts of small rocks etc was filling them, ending up looking like the shoes had a skirt.Get a grip Adidas and go back to make good shoes again, because these were garbage."
Adidas,29,99.99,2023-09-01,4.5,"These def run big. I’m a women’s 6 and landed on a men’s 4.5 after trying a couple sizes. I have a pretty narrow foot and the width of these is great for me. They have pretty good arch support too-much better than the Stan Smiths. I’ve been wanting these for a while and while they’re very cute in person, I’m slightly disappointed in the quality. The tongue is plastic and there are a couple of pieces of leather overlay that are cut sloppily. You can’t tell when they’re on so it’s not a huge deal, just annoying. Overall would repurchase."
Adidas,29,99.99,2023-10-06,4.5,This is a comfortable shoe. You first have to make sure if the size. This shoe runs one whole size larger. Unless you order 3 sizes you will not get the correct fit. The shoe I ended up with is a half size to big. But I wore them out so I'm stuck with them. This shoe also squeaks. You will have to put powder on the tongue to make it stop. But it could also be from this shoe being to big.
Adidas,29,99.99,2024-01-30,4.5,I only really buy shoes unless I absolutely have to but I got these just cause I liked them and they have no disappointed. I used my sisters Ugg waterproof spray on them cause crep can destroy the suede and it worked. My only complaint is the tongue is a little weird but you just need to break it in and it's fine. It was also 2 day shipping despite coming from another state so I was very happy with that.
Adidas,29,99.99,2024-01-02,4.5,My daughter has 3 pairs of Gazelles. She loves them! Got her the brown ones for Christmas. They really are very cute. I love the leather tongue. They are comfortable. True to size. Super trendy.
Adidas,29,99.99,2021-06-14,4.5,"This is probably my 5th or 6th pair of gazelles since I got my first ones in the 90’s. I love the design, they’re timeless and comfortable once worn in. Unfortunately a few years ago Adidas made the the ill advised decision to change the tongue, it’s no longer the subtle white leather tongue but a rather large one that seems to be made from synthetic material. Firstly, it really doesn’t look good. Secondly, it makes a squeaky noise that doesn’t stop once they’re worn in and thirdly, it presses onto the top of the foot, which makes the shoes more uncomfortable than they used to be. It basically looks, feels and sounds cheap but you still pay £70!!I’d advise first time buyers to look for another design/shoes but anyone who has had gazelles before like me is probably ... MoreThis is probably my 5th or 6th pair of gazelles since I got my first ones in the 90’s.

Adidas,29,99.99,2024-03-16,4.5,"These are cool shoes and I get a lot of compliments on them! The tongue of the shoe is plastic so they were pretty squeaky when I walked, however, I just put some vaseline where it was rubbing and it stopped! The packaging also was a little damaged when I got it. Overall, great shoes!"
Adidas,29,99.99,2024-01-31,4.5,"Brilliant trainers . I have a few pairs of Gazelles and I really like the colour of these . Fantastic price and speedy delivery . They even put in a different colour spare laces in so that was a nice touch . When I need some more trainers , I'll be buying from here again"
Adidas,29,99.99,2024-01-02,4.5,"Hi! I asked for these shoes for Christmas, and was more than pleasantly surprised! I got a size too big at first, but when I returned for the correct size, I was in love! They fit beautifully, and look beautiful too! Will definitely be wearing a ton in the next few months."
Adidas,29,99.99,2023-10-20,4.5,"i had these sneakers years ago and they were my favourites. I tried to buy them again now but the quality is not the same. First of all, the white parts are all of different whites so it looks so cheap, but the overall material is just thin and has a plasticky feeling.So disappointed"
Nike,30,94.99,2024-03-11,4.7,"I just bought these last week and wore them for the first time today. ~5 hours of walking and standing with no complaints at all. I am very impressed. Very comfortable, no break-in period, excellent for people with wide feet. Awesome daily sneaker, only con is they're a good bit heavier than the shoes I typically wear daily (Hoka Bondi, New Balance 1080, Brooks Ghost). For reference, I'm a size 14 and wear a 2E in all my athletic shoes. Didn't need a wide option for these."
Nike,30,94.99,2023-10-15,4.7,"The shows feels good as soon as you put it on. My normal got it is the AF1, but wanted some everyday kicks that I didn’t have to match - classic colors that go with everything. These are the combo of what Nike does best - lighter than AF1, but roomy on the inside. Sole is like a dunk or Jordan 1. Super comfortable. Hope they continue with these."
Nike,30,94.99,2024-03-12,4.7,Super stoked with this purchase!!! These look super sick!!! The leather on these is amazing quality!! Sometime nikes has some thin leather and crease easy. These don't!! Definitely made well. Shipping was crazy fast 2. Ordered 2 days ago and already showed up on my door step.
Nike,30,94.99,2024-03-17,4.7,"Normally I don’t write reviews but this shoe is too good to not let others know! If you want an AF1 + Jordan’s feel to a shoe that is a bit cheaper this is the shoe to buy! I would size up half a size (or a full size; it depends) if you don’t want a snug fit or tend to wear thicker socks, otherwise this unisex shoe is great 10/10!"
Nike,30,94.99,2024-01-09,4.7,I bought these shoes for Christmas for my 12 year old son and he absolutely loved them. He doesn’t usually follow the trend he likes to look different from what everyone else wears like the “Pandas”. This shoe is great comfortable and stylish shoe. I’m happy and he’s happy.
Nike,30,94.99,2023-11-22,4.7,The photos definitely don’t do them justice but these shoes are absolutely beautiful in person and up close with them. They can be so universally styled with many different outfits. This is a great show for anyone who is into shoes like dunks or air forces but wants to expand they’re horizons.
Nike,30,94.99,2024-03-24,4.7,My grandson (13) loves these Nike shoes. Loves the style to wear with his jogger pants. Size 12. Fits perfect. He ordered the pair with the orange basketball on the tung as he's into basketball. Nice shoe.
Nike,30,94.99,2023-10-24,4.7,Got a pair of Nikes after being denied on the SNKRS app for years. Nice shoe for the price. Sole is super comfy feels like a dunk with more cushion. Roomy in the toes. Only issue is the sides slightly rub my ankle.
Nike,30,94.99,2023-10-19,4.7,Really good show! Just bought it recently thinking it would fit like an Air Force (where you have to size down). Not in this case! The shoe fit true to size!Affordable shoe!
Nike,30,94.99,2024-03-06,4.7,"Bought these for my son. He loves the look and says they were comfortable. He usually can't wear Nike sneakers because he has wide feet, but these don't bother him. Got them on sale which was a bonus."
Nike,31,170.0,2024-01-18,4.7,Liked the shoe overall and decided to buy from StockX as they had a better price. After fees it came to $147 which is still great. After receiving the shoe I put it on the legit check app and it came back authentic so overall really happy buying from StockX.
Nike,31,170.0,2023-05-16,4.7,"Awesome sneaker!! Great condition and all the style might not be for everyone, but good service overall i would recommend, but the shipping needs some work, price to steep to take that long to arrive from stockx"
Nike,31,170.0,2023-10-07,4.7,Love the shoe and its very nice quality except for the fact the spikes on the bottom fall off after a few uses. Only complaint was that this took a couple weeks to ship.
Nike,31,170.0,2024-01-15,4.7,"Feels good on the feet , spikes on the bottom makes you feel like you’re standing on something squishy on hard floors, but over time I know they will where off and feel like a regular Air Force One , but I like them ."
Nike,31,170.0,2023-04-17,4.7,Very unique and interesting design. The shoe should be way more popular and valuable than it is. Definitely an overlooked shoe.
Nike,31,170.0,2022-12-15,4.7,I think they are a very unique dope looking shoe comfortable and for being Off-Whites they are relatively cheap in price and feel like they are durable and would last a long time
Nike,31,170.0,2023-04-21,4.7,Very good product. Came brand new and was in perfect condition. I love these!
Nike,31,170.0,2023-05-09,4.7,"they are very comfortable and convenient, only because they are made in China and I don't know if they are original"
Nike,31,170.0,2023-03-27,4.7,The shoe came looking like it was tried on. I have no clue why it came with creases on the back as if someone out it on without a shoe horn.
Nike,31,170.0,2024-02-13,4.7,"After a long time, I finally own a proper pair of shoes… Finally! <3"
Nike,32,80.0,2023-07-07,4.6,"Very nice looking shoes but its very uncomfortable. Its fits perfectly but the middle bit digs into the side of my feet and it hurts. I had that with previous Nike shoes I used to own years ago and it didn't bother me at all. This time it did bother me and I'm not happy. For that, I won't be buying Nike shoes again. Why should I spend so much money on a pair of shoes to inflict pain and discomfort on myself? It's ridiculous. That is not on so thats why I gave it a one star rating. Why does Nike design their shoes like that? Next time I buy new shoes I don't want the middle part to press against the side of my feet! Fortunately I was able to fix the issue and make it a lot less uncomfortable by removing the in-sole and swap it with the one from my old shoes. Thats ... MoreVery nice looking shoes but its very uncomfortable. Its fits perfectly but the middle bit digs into the side of my feet and it hurts.

I even punched the insides of the shoe to force the middle bit to open up and make a bit more room. Now the Nike shoes are a lot less uncomfortable and tolerable. Next time buy comfortable shoes instead of tolerable levels of discomfort you can allow. Less"

The shoes are listed here at such a price because they are not good shoes. When I attempted to return the manager at the Columbia MD store yelled at me like a criminal, “we don’t take used items!!” I am not sure how else my sons would have determined the shoes were problematic without wearing to school. Bad experience all around. Walked out of the store and left the shoes there. Nordstrom Rack would not refund my account and I did not want such painful shoes. Bad service all around. Don’t order from them. It is not worth the hassle. 10 dollars to return or deal with store staff mistreating you.

Nike,32,80.0,2023-12-08,4.6,"Purchased on a Thursday at 15:00, arrived the Friday at 12:00. Great delivery, and the trainers look great at first glance. The white midsole has a light speckled effect which wasn’t clear on photos but looks nice in person. There was a piece of tape securing the box closed which was appreciated, however there is no protective paper in the shoebox with the trainers just placed inside. These are a gift so haven’t worn them but on close inspection there are a few minor imperfections where the midsole meets the trainer and areas where glue is used - not an issue for me nor gift recipient but would definitely bother a serious sneaker-head."
Nike,32,80.0,2023-02-18,4.6,"recently picked up a pair of Nike Court Vision Low sneakers and I have to say, I'm really impressed! First of all, they look great - the classic design is super clean and versatile. But beyond their good looks, they're also incredibly comfortable. The insole has a nice amount of cushioning, and the upper is made from a durable yet breathable material. In terms of sizing, I found them to be true to size - I went with my usual size and they fit perfectly.One thing I really love about these sneakers is that they have a similar aesthetic to the iconic Air Force 1's, but with a less chunky profile.

Nike,32,80.0,2023-05-21,4.6,"I prefer the Court Vision over Air Force 1 because it’s not expensive to replace when they get worn out. They’re much better for everyday wear when you don’t want to wear out the Air Force 1s. I bought a pair of these Navy Blue and I can’t tell them apart from the black ones I have because the blue is too dark. I wish they would make these with blue on the bottom so they stay looking cleaner and actually make the blue visible. I think people think they’re buying Air Force 1s when they buy Court Vision, they’re not fake. Court Vision is a cheaper style but still a very comfortable durable shoe."
Nike,32,80.0,2022-12-04,4.6,"I loved the style of these shoes. I got the grey with red swoosh. However the quality is atrocious. They use stiff, hard materials. It almost feels like you’re walking around in clogs. From the rubber on the bottoms, to the “leather” they use for the uppers. It’s all hard. Needless to say, the insoles are trash too. You may as well plan on adding that to your cart immediately. Another issue was the top of the shoe are so high they rub against my ankle bone, so I had to double up the heel part of the insole to alleviate some of the rubbing. Go Nike!Nothing bad to say about Academy though, they are always stellar. Friendly staff, always there to help if you need it, and great return policy, although I chose to keep these as a part-time shoe."
Nike,32,80.0,2023-10-12,4.6,"I love the classic clean look. This is a very comfortable elegant yet sporty looking shoe. I love the color scheme it matches perfectly with my University of Alabama apparel, roll tide. I'm a middle aged guy that loves sneakers. The moment I saw these sneakers they were a must have for me! This was a great buy economically and fashion wise. I love them definitely a must have for sneaker enthusiasts."
Nike,32,80.0,2024-01-24,4.6,"They looked nice upon arrival but after closer inspection, there were a bunch of small creases by the toe joint area. I tried them on and walked around once. Some of the creases became more noticeable. I am going to return these. Listen to the other reviews on the Courts. These are my first pairs of Courts so I don't know if its Courts in general or the new recycled material Nike is using."
Nike,32,80.0,2023-07-16,4.6,"Not sure if all the court visions are like this now, but the sail and beetroot feels cheap. Great color way, but all the ""leather"" is synthetic. The lining isn't sown in on one side near the lace holes. Shoes had marks on them. When they crease it's unnatural due to fake leather. Really not a good quality sneaker. Made in India."
Nike,32,80.0,2024-01-01,4.6,"I have the old ones from 2019, before the recycled garbage.They are comfy, real leather mixed in, crease lightly with no discomfort, and even then I bought for real low at the outlet. These new ones are so bad, and the leather so fake it feels like you are walking in 3d printed plastic shoes. It's painful and the creased lines crack.For the price, I would never recommend"
Nike,33,101.0,2023-12-18,4.4,The color is more beautiful in hand! They fit perfectly! I bought these for myself for Christmas and Iâ€™m in love! Been feeling the neutral colors especially the green color this season because I been feeling more grounded and these dunks just proves that Iâ€™m standing on business lol.
Nike,33,101.0,2023-11-13,4.4,I purchased these shoes for my grandson and he absolutely loves them. I can tell he loves him because itâ€™s the first pair of shoes he actually cares about keeping cleaning wipes them off himself. they are the perfect fit a little wider than his normal shoes which are Nikes as well.
Nike,33,101.0,2023-05-06,4.4,yooooo the shoes I got from here were the best I've ever gotten. They were so comfy I could sleep in them! I would definitely come back here with more remorse and buy a lot. When I came into the store I was welcomed with great customer service and saw some amazing shoes and clothing!
Nike,33,101.0,2023-09-03,4.4,"Got exactly what i ordered in a very timely manner. Its hard to find Dunks in my size, but they had them in stock. They arrived before another pair of shoes that i ordered from another website. The price and quality were both great, and I appreciated the updates."
Nike,33,101.0,2023-03-09,4.4,The shoes have marks all over them the toe box is smashed. And when I reached out to them they said I msg the wrong department. When it is the department they said to use. I asked to be sent to the right one. Well they just never replied. So I am stuck with a used set of shoes. I would not recommend Stock X to my enemies. They only care about making money for there selfs
Nike,33,101.0,2023-12-15,4.4,"These do not seem to be authentic. The writing on the box was all in Chinese and the quality does not seem the same as previous Dunks purchased directly from Nike. I am keeping them because they are a Xmas gift for my son, but would love for you to improve you verification process."
Nike,33,101.0,2023-08-25,4.4,"Bought these for my son, he loves them. They fit great! Hibbett is one of my favorite places to shop for shoes. They have a nice variety and selection of shoes and clothing of popular styles and at good prices!!"
Nike,33,101.0,2024-03-18,4.4,"looks even better in person, however i would size up a half size for a lil bit more comfort. but other than that the colors and overall its a good look. and i dont know about everyone else but first wears are always uncomfortable"
Nike,33,101.0,2023-11-30,4.4,"This dunk looks even better in hand. It is a shoe that when I look at it, makes me happy! Love the sizing of dunks because they are roomy with a nice wide tie box. I can not believe with the beauty of this shoe, thatâ€™s itâ€™s still available."
Nike,33,101.0,2023-06-23,4.4,I luv the product but not so much what i paid for it. So far i like the stockx site. I receive the product promptly and the site was easy to navigate. I found some other sneakers that i can't find anywhere else. I want them but the price is way to high.
Nike,34,89.99,2024-04-17,4.3,"Believe it or not, this is my very first pair of Nikes. I have never liked Nike shoes because of their fit. They were never comfortable. I don't even pay attention to them. But these caught my eye. So I tried them on and of course they felt tight and not comfortable. But I decided to take them home anyway and walk around the house for a couple of days. Tried different socks with them and just when I thought I was going to take them back, I decided to keep them. They are still not the fitment I normally like. But I'll give them a go. They aight."
Nike,34,89.99,2023-09-05,4.3,"Extremely disappointed... They look great and feel ok. But less than two weeks after buying them, they both started squeaking with EVERY STEP! Super embarrassing and aggravating... One of the very few times in my life, that Nike has disappointed Me.... I had to return them. . . Then went with a different brand... C'mon Nike, it's 2023! Do y'all even product test anymore? Or just manufacturer as many as possible as cheap as possible? This was straight up, unacceptable. Y'all GOTTA Step your game up!"
Nike,34,89.99,2018-04-21,4.3,"To Whom It May Concern,On April 7 2018 my wife and I purchased two pairs of sneakers, one pair for myself and one pair for her at store #579 located in Neshaminy Mall in Bensalem Pa.

Within 3 days I thought I heard a noise coming from the left sneaker and on the 5th day the squeaking noise was extremely loud.

I asked for the manager and Jessica said she was the manger. I proceeded to tell her about my sneakers and the noise they were making. Jessica's exact words were I CAN'T HELP YOU BECAUSE YOU WALKED IN MY STORE WITH THOSE SNEAKERS ON YOUR FEET. I had to leave the store walk in the mall to a bench take the shoes off my feet walk back to your store in my socks and hand her the bag. After all that she rolled her eyes and asked if I wanted the same pair I said yes but you did not have the same color but I received the same sneaker but a different color. I could not believe how she handled the situation. After a few days with the new sneakers started to squeak again. On April 20, 2018 I decide to return the sneakers again and get a different style or type of sneaker. When I went into the store this time I made sure the shoes were in the box with the bag and my receipt. When I approached the register The cashier needed an override and asked for the manager in which Jessica came to the counter and said exact words YOU WAS IN HERE LAST WEEK AND I'M NOT DOING THIS AGAIN BECAUSE I'M LOOSING MONEY.

Nike,34,89.99,2022-09-13,4.3,"These shoes look great and a very comfortable. However after wearing them awhile I remembered why I don't normally buy Nike shoes. The build quality is very poor. The adhesive and layers in the soles are failing after very light use and make an awful squeaking noise that sounds like you've walked in a puddle and are now walking on a polished tile floor while trying to be as annoying as possible.If you only wear them in places that are loud it might be okay, but if you're walking on any surface in a normal environment then you'll be squeaking with every step."

Nike,34,89.99,2022-08-17,4.3,"I bought a pair of these because they were so comfortable in the store. Met us with some friends about a week later and my buddy said he had a pair like them and that they started squeaking after about 2 weeks. Played it off and sure enough, one week later they started this annoying squeak. Should have returned them but kept them because they were really comfortable. The outer stared falling apart and they became grass cutting shoes. Don't buy these unless you want some really fancy grass shoes."
Nike,34,89.99,2023-06-05,4.3,This is my 2nd pair of Reax 8 Training shoes. Both of them began to squeak after about 3 to 4 months. They are comfortable. I use them at the gym for weight lifting and at physical therapy. The squeak is starting to get on my nerves and is embarrassing as you walk past people with your squeaky shoes.
Nike,34,89.99,2020-10-27,4.3,"I've owned a few pairs of this exact shoe over the past few years. They are generally comfortable. Tread pattern appears unimpressive and shallow, so that wears pretty quickly, but I didn't find that to be a problem from a function standpoint.The squeak/click that began a couple of weeks into my first pair was upsetting. It sounded like a small rock was stuck in the tread. Through research and experimentation I figured out how to fix the ""squeak"". I spray a little bit of WD-40 into the spot where each strut joints the bottom of the shoe, approaching from the outside of the shoe. (See picture) Periodically, I need to re-do the WD-40 treatment, especially if i get the shoes significantly wet with water."
Nike,34,89.99,2024-02-26,4.3,Worst shoe ever!! Squeaks loudly after a day of walking. I trained in them once and they started making noise. I started only wearing them on rainy days to make it make sense. Donâ€™t buy this shoe unless youâ€™re fine with everybody turning to stare at you and your squeaky shoes.
Nike,34,89.99,2022-12-23,4.3,"Comfortable, and on were on sale---but! After two days the sole on the left shoe started squeaking and has gotten louder. Soon the right shoe joined in. Fortunately someone else had mentioned that in a review so I ordered a pair of the SC running shoes (also on sale) as back up. These are my outdoor shoes now. They are pretty annoying inside, but great outside with background noise!"
Nike,35,69.0,2022-11-30,4.5,"I have worn Nikes almost exclusively for 25 years and this is the first pair that has been total junk. They lack support (my casual shoes offer more than this athletic shoe) and actually wear my feet out due to the hardness of the foam. There isn't any cushiness to them nor support. I'm used to both. What's worse, all of the glue in the soles are letting go. I've been having to re-glue the rubber tread back onto the foam and yesterday, the foam itself peeled away from the shell of the shoe. My shoes are casually worn around the house and in town - no harsh activities and yet they're falling apart. Total garbage and a disappointment from Nike."

Nike,35,69.0,2022-07-10,4.5,"This is the third pair of the Nike Revolution 5 I’ve bought, the previous shoes had the fly ease zipper & strap but I couldn’t find one in my size this time.This shoe is made the same, but only laces…it takes a little time to break them in, at first they’re tight… but they’re so comfortable and light when you do. They can easily go into the washing machine, but be careful about fading with your choice of detergents. They are well designed, versatile for every day wear or running, lightweight and comfortable, how ever I prefer the fly ease design more. I’m happy Academy had this pair in my size because they’re an older design and hard to find in stores and online."

Nike,35,69.0,2021-08-03,4.5,"Once again the click n collect was very easy. Got the message and email stating my shoes were ready to collect quite quickly. The fit and comfort was perfect, but, a little over a month later, the shoes started to make some popping noises - at first I thought it was rocks, sticks or something caught up underneath shoes but after very close examination, there didnt seem to be anything on the surface! I can only assume it's internal, maybe the soul or the second rubber layer, don't know? So now I just have to deal with the ""popping"" sounds each time i step, very annoying! I've had Nikes for most of my 50yrs on this earth and this is the first Nike pair I've had a problem with."
Nike,35,69.0,2020-09-30,4.5,"The shoes look and feel as advertised, and they're very comfortable (especially for Nikes - I have wide feet and normally can't wear most styles of Nike sneakers). However, the soles are sort of a honeycomb pattern with little inverted bubbles; depending on where you put your weight when you walk, these bubbles essentially form a seal against the ground with each step, and then when you pick your foot up, the seal breaks with a little popping sound. Basically it sounds like I'm stepping on a piece of bubble wrap every time I take a step. It's tremendously annoying and effectively makes the shoes unwearable except on grass or carpet. I would not buy these again."
Nike,35,69.0,2021-03-19,4.5,"Excellent shoes!!! Love them so much, so comfortable, so nice too see and wear.I usually run for 5 and more miles few times per week and this shoes are perfect(for no professional runners obviously).They are so comfortable that I sometime wear them for the entire day ahah.I highly highly raccomand them also because they are relatively cheap!! The black ones are top!!Just to mentioned : I stained them with some white painting and it doesn`t go away...WellI guess it is my fault..other than that they are Five Stars!!!"
Nike,35,69.0,2020-09-30,4.5,"I’ve bought a few pairs or these shoes and the toes always wear a hole in the top of the shoes. It’s really annoying because I’m a nurse so I am on my feet all day and some days I’m truly running.. they aren’t bad priced but I’d expect the the last longer then just 2-3 months! And yes, I do make sure my toenails are clipped regularly. Lol. Also, I wear a size 9.5 and some of the pairs have fit smaller then other Nike shoes even though there the exact same type, brand, style, ect.. I’ve even compared the shoes toe to toe and you can easily see that the 2 kinds of shoes are larger then the other, even though there the same brand and style. I also have coworkers that have had the same issues as I have with holes coming in on the toe area of the shoes."
Nike,35,69.0,2022-03-26,4.5,"I bought this shoe as it was time to replace my other shoes. On the first run, I noticed that the shoe was rubbing extensively against my right ankle. I kept running, thinking that this was just part of me needing to break in the shoe. When I finished my run, I looked down and my sock was soaked in blood. The shoe had rubbed my right ankle so much and so hard that my ankle was bleeding extensively. This is definitely not what I had in mind. I’m very disappointed in Nike with this one!"
Nike,36,90.0,2024-04-22,5.0,Had a pair of nylon CORTEZ like 20 years ago. I had to get me this one when I seen it was available in my size again. More comfortable then I remember. My favorite pair of nikes.

I didn't linger the fabric..I was so embarrassed and insulted the way the manager was telling her boss about the shoes.I received them that way.They tried to tell me they weren't going to return them. I got angry and said fine I'll do it and I'm calling corporate and I need your name because her name tag was covered.That's when they agreed to return and took 30+ minutes doing so.I will never buy anything from Hibbetts Sports again.I will tell everyone I know about my experience.
Nike,37,95.0,2023-09-30,4.6,"Easily ordered and delivery was before promised delivery date i received that's ok. Onto the actual trainers, they are great material, great fit, infact I wore them straight away inside the house no issues. However on the second day of wearing them, it is if the bubble on the sole has burst and I am getting a noise each time I place my foot on the floor then lift it up, was in the supermarket and each step I took is annoying.i could return them but I cannot be bothered, just going to write them off and hand into local charity shop. So giving them a 2 star as I got to wear them outside for one day before they started to make a squeak. Dissapointed."
Nike,37,95.0,2023-04-30,4.6,"Great fit, perfect everyday wear for my 11 year son. He hasn't complained not once since I bought him those shoes. And thet is hard to make happen. So that you Academy for having such great products to sell. And a special thanks to Nike for making the shoe that my son loves so much and fits his everyday needs. They help him run better and he doesnt side and they grip the ground. Thanks again"

Disappointed for my son, the other kids are giving him grief about the loud squeak.Won't buy again"

This is definitely one of the most comfortable shoes I've ever had but my issue is, the three pair that I have bought of these all three pair squeak and that really sucks!!!"

I wasn’t sure if I can return since he wore them for 3 weeks. I brought them to shoe repairs and they won’t repair sneakers. I finally contacted ASOS and it has passed their deadline for returning. Not a good shopping experience."
Nike,37,95.0,2023-06-05,4.6,"These shoes are comfortable I want to wear everywhere but like others have said squeak squeak squeak rubber ducky is annoying, mine started on the right shoe then it stopped and started on the left one.

Nike,37,95.0,2024-03-11,4.6,Picked these up to replace current running shoe for workouts. I bought this shoe 3 weeks ago and couldn't be happier. Very comfortable and supportive to my feed. The heel cushion is fantastic. Great for long walks. Ture to sizing and stable.
Nike,37,95.0,2024-02-15,4.6,"The shoes started coming apart less than one year after purchase. I didn't wear the shoes everyday. Per nike, they have a two year warranty. Went back to the store and was told they were unable to help me. Nike said send them back and if we decide it was a manufacturer defect they would replace the shoes, but there was no guarantee."
Nike,37,95.0,2023-08-14,4.6,These shoes are a perfect neutral. The colors go well with pretty much anything. My son chose them as his back-to-school shoes for 7th grade and was excited to wear them his first day! They clean up easily and fit as expected. They are not too wide or narrow. Perfection!

I am a woman, I’d hate to see how this fits a man with a wider foot than me. Returning. Very disappointed because I like the green color way."

Get half a size to a full size larger than you normally would. They also have a break-in period (about 20-25 miles) before they really feel ""right."" I personally got a half size larger and broke them in walking, plus I would bend the toe against the floor to stretch it out."

Nike,39,95.0,2024-03-11,4.7,"I just bought these last week and wore them for the first time today. ~5 hours of walking and standing with no complaints at all. I am very impressed. Very comfortable, no break-in period, excellent for people with wide feet. Awesome daily sneaker, only con is they're a good bit heavier than the shoes I typically wear daily (Hoka Bondi, New Balance 1080, Brooks Ghost). For reference, I'm a size 14 and wear a 2E in all my athletic shoes. Didn't need a wide option for these."
Nike,39,95.0,2023-10-15,4.7,"The shows feels good as soon as you put it on. My normal got it is the AF1, but wanted some everyday kicks that I didn’t have to match - classic colors that go with everything. These are the combo of what Nike does best - lighter than AF1, but roomy on the inside. Sole is like a dunk or Jordan 1. Super comfortable. Hope they continue with these."

If you want an AF1 + Jordan’s feel to a shoe that is a bit cheaper this is the shoe to buy! I would size up half a size (or a full size; it depends) if you don’t want a snug fit or tend to wear thicker socks, otherwise this unisex shoe is great 10/10!"
Nike,39,95.0,2024-01-09,4.7,I bought these shoes for Christmas for my 12 year old son and he absolutely loved them. He doesn’t usually follow the trend he likes to look different from what everyone else wears like the “Pandas”. This shoe is great comfortable and stylish shoe. I’m happy and he’s happy.
Nike,39,95.0,2023-11-22,4.7,The photos definitely don’t do them justice but these shoes are absolutely beautiful in person and up close with them. They can be so universally styled with many different outfits. This is a great show for anyone who is into shoes like dunks or air forces but wants to expand they’re horizons.
Nike,39,95.0,2024-03-24,4.7,My grandson (13) loves these Nike shoes. Loves the style to wear with his jogger pants. Size 12. Fits perfect. He ordered the pair with the orange basketball on the tung as he's into basketball. Nice shoe.
Nike,39,95.0,2023-10-24,4.7,Got a pair of Nikes after being denied on the SNKRS app for years. Nice shoe for the price. Sole is super comfy feels like a dunk with more cushion. Roomy in the toes. Only issue is the sides slightly rub my ankle.
Nike,39,95.0,2023-10-19,4.7,Really good show! Just bought it recently thinking it would fit like an Air Force (where you have to size down). Not in this case! The shoe fit true to size!Affordable shoe!
Nike,39,95.0,2024-03-06,4.7,"Bought these for my son. He loves the look and says they were comfortable. He usually can't wear Nike sneakers because he has wide feet, but these don't bother him. Got them on sale which was a bonus."
Nike,40,90.0,2024-04-15,5.0,Great fit and very great cushioning great for speed and protection
Nike,43,146.0,2023-12-18,4.4,The color is more beautiful in hand! They fit perfectly! I bought these for myself for Christmas and Iâ€™m in love! Been feeling the neutral colors especially the green color this season because I been feeling more grounded and these dunks just proves that Iâ€™m standing on business lol.
Nike,43,146.0,2023-11-13,4.4,I purchased these shoes for my grandson and he absolutely loves them. I can tell he loves him because itâ€™s the first pair of shoes he actually cares about keeping cleaning wipes them off himself. they are the perfect fit a little wider than his normal shoes which are Nikes as well.
Nike,43,146.0,2023-05-06,4.4,yooooo the shoes I got from here were the best I've ever gotten. They were so comfy I could sleep in them! I would definitely come back here with more remorse and buy a lot. When I came into the store I was welcomed with great customer service and saw some amazing shoes and clothing!
Nike,43,146.0,2023-09-03,4.4,"Got exactly what i ordered in a very timely manner. Its hard to find Dunks in my size, but they had them in stock. They arrived before another pair of shoes that i ordered from another website. The price and quality were both great, and I appreciated the updates."
Nike,43,146.0,2023-03-09,4.4,The shoes have marks all over them the toe box is smashed. And when I reached out to them they said I msg the wrong department. When it is the department they said to use. I asked to be sent to the right one. Well they just never replied. So I am stuck with a used set of shoes. I would not recommend Stock X to my enemies. They only care about making money for there selfs
Nike,43,146.0,2023-12-15,4.4,"These do not seem to be authentic. The writing on the box was all in Chinese and the quality does not seem the same as previous Dunks purchased directly from Nike. I am keeping them because they are a Xmas gift for my son, but would love for you to improve you verification process."
Nike,43,146.0,2023-08-25,4.4,"Bought these for my son, he loves them. They fit great! Hibbett is one of my favorite places to shop for shoes. They have a nice variety and selection of shoes and clothing of popular styles and at good prices!!"
Nike,43,146.0,2024-03-18,4.4,"looks even better in person, however i would size up a half size for a lil bit more comfort. but other than that the colors and overall its a good look. and i dont know about everyone else but first wears are always uncomfortable"
Nike,43,146.0,2023-11-30,4.4,"This dunk looks even better in hand. It is a shoe that when I look at it, makes me happy! Love the sizing of dunks because they are roomy with a nice wide tie box. I can not believe with the beauty of this shoe, thatâ€™s itâ€™s still available."
Nike,43,146.0,2023-06-23,4.4,I luv the product but not so much what i paid for it. So far i like the stockx site. I receive the product promptly and the site was easy to navigate. I found some other sneakers that i can't find anywhere else. I want them but the price is way to high.
Nike,44,60.0,2023-07-07,4.6,"Very nice looking shoes but its very uncomfortable. Its fits perfectly but the middle bit digs into the side of my feet and it hurts. I had that with previous Nike shoes I used to own years ago and it didn't bother me at all. This time it did bother me and I'm not happy. For that, I won't be buying Nike shoes again. Why should I spend so much money on a pair of shoes to inflict pain and discomfort on myself? It's ridiculous. That is not on so thats why I gave it a one star rating. Why does Nike design their shoes like that? Next time I buy new shoes I don't want the middle part to press against the side of my feet! Fortunately I was able to fix the issue and make it a lot less uncomfortable by removing the in-sole and swap it with the one from my old shoes.

The white midsole has a light speckled effect which wasn’t clear on photos but looks nice in person. There was a piece of tape securing the box closed which was appreciated, however there is no protective paper in the shoebox with the trainers just placed inside. These are a gift so haven’t worn them but on close inspection there are a few minor imperfections where the midsole meets the trainer and areas where glue is used - not an issue for me nor gift recipient but would definitely bother a serious sneaker-head."

Nike,44,60.0,2023-05-21,4.6,"I prefer the Court Vision over Air Force 1 because it’s not expensive to replace when they get worn out. They’re much better for everyday wear when you don’t want to wear out the Air Force 1s. I bought a pair of these Navy Blue and I can’t tell them apart from the black ones I have because the blue is too dark. I wish they would make these with blue on the bottom so they stay looking cleaner and actually make the blue visible. I think people think they’re buying Air Force 1s when they buy Court Vision, they’re not fake. Court Vision is a cheaper style but still a very comfortable durable shoe."
Nike,44,60.0,2022-12-04,4.6,"I loved the style of these shoes. I got the grey with red swoosh. However the quality is atrocious. They use stiff, hard materials. It almost feels like you’re walking around in clogs. From the rubber on the bottoms, to the “leather” they use for the uppers. It’s all hard. Needless to say, the insoles are trash too. You may as well plan on adding that to your cart immediately. Another issue was the top of the shoe are so high they rub against my ankle bone, so I had to double up the heel part of the insole to alleviate some of the rubbing. Go Nike!Nothing bad to say about Academy though, they are always stellar. Friendly staff, always there to help if you need it, and great return policy, although I chose to keep these as a part-time shoe."

I love the color scheme it matches perfectly with my University of Alabama apparel, roll tide. I'm a middle aged guy that loves sneakers. The moment I saw these sneakers they were a must have for me! This was a great buy economically and fashion wise. I love them definitely a must have for sneaker enthusiasts."
Nike,44,60.0,2024-01-24,4.6,"They looked nice upon arrival but after closer inspection, there were a bunch of small creases by the toe joint area. I tried them on and walked around once. Some of the creases became more noticeable. I am going to return these. Listen to the other reviews on the Courts. These are my first pairs of Courts so I don't know if its Courts in general or the new recycled material Nike is using."

Now to the shoe, I would say that it’s aesthetically pleasing. I have the “Trivia” colorway, which consists of a predominately tan mesh and leather upper with hits of blue and purple on the heel, blue ankle collar, a green Nike check that wraps around the heel, a white midsole, and orange tongue tag and sole. The colors really come together in a complementary way. At one point while I was in the gym, a stranger actually came up to me to tell me that they liked my shoes, just further reinforcing that these look good. As a stated in the opening, I really don’t ball that much anymore, but I did get on the court a little and put up some shots to see how the shoes feel doing what they are made for. Based on my experiences, I would say that these will get the job done for a lot of people. It’s a light shoe so it won’t feel heavy on your foot and it features a thick ankle collar, so you do feel locked in once you get the shoe on and tied up which is a good thing. Speaking about my feet quickly, I’m flatfooted so some narrow shoes end up clamping down on the sides of foot creating a pain after a while. I did not have a problem with this shoe as there is a solid amount of room in the forefoot area while still creating that lockdown seen in the ankle portion, so wide footed individuals should be fine with this shoe. You also get very good traction in the shoes and you are pretty low to the ground in them, so you shouldn’t have any problems with quick changes of direction or stopping and starting which makes sense as these are tailored to an explosive guard. That being said, cushioning in the shoe was surprising in its lacklusterness. There is an Air Zoom unit in the forefoot, but it must be a smaller one because I couldn’t really feel it at all while wearing the shoe. Comfort wise, in general I wouldn’t say that they are unconformable, but they are also not very comfortable either; they fall somewhere in the middle as the cushioning in them isn’t the best, so if you need more impact protection I would probably look else where.In terms of wearing these casually, these are solid. Lately basketball shoes are made for the purpose of being worn strictly on court, but these in particular lend themselves to be off the court as well. They are low-cut sneakers that are mostly a neutral color so they can go with a variety of outfits and color schemes. With them being as flat as they are, they make for good gym shoes and that’s where I wear them at predominately and will continue to do so, but I have worn them a few times at my job in the hospital setting and they held up well there and look good with scrubs.Overall, this is a fine shoe that will look to fill in the gap that the Kyrie Line occupied and I think they have a chance to do that. For me, these make great gym shoes and I will be wearing them for a long time there. Less"

The outsole pattern is specifically designed to maximize traction, allowing for quick stops, explosive movements, and tight turns with complete confidence. I found myself able to make swift changes in direction without any slippage or loss of control. This superior grip is a game-changer, enhancing my agility and giving me a competitive edge.Beyond the shoe's performance features, the JA 1 also boasts an eye-catching design. Nike has combined sleek aesthetics with bold color choices, making these shoes a stylish statement on and off the court. The attention to detail, such as the iconic Nike branding and the unique patterns, adds an extra touch of flair that sets the JA 1 apart from other basketball shoes.Furthermore, the build quality of the JA 1 is exceptional. The materials used feel durable and resilient, ensuring that these shoes will withstand the demands of intense basketball sessions.

Nike,46,117.0,2023-06-25,4.4,"I snagged me a pair of these Ja Morant 1's because I really wanted to try a pair out. Nike never seemed to do a mass release of the Midnight colorway (other than in a pop-up store outside the Vivint Smart Home Arena for this year's All-Star game in Salt Lake City), so I went with this pair to get a feel for how these shoes felt. I was very impressed by them.

Nike never seemed to do a mass release of the Midnight colorway (other than in a pop-up store outside the Vivint Smart Home Arena for this year's All-Star game in Salt Lake City), so I went with this pair to get a feel for how these shoes felt.

A lot of player's basketball shoes these days are being modeled after the Kobe Bryant's (i.e. a low-top, almost soccer-like look to them, rather than the previously popular high tops that everyone seemed to sport in games) and these were no different. I've never really been much into this design but figured I would take a step into them and give 'em a try. I just always thought that they would not provide the proper support that most high tops seems to offer. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised though! I still might not give them as much credit as the high top basketball shoes still, but they really DO provide some VERY good support. A big part of that, in these particular shoes anyway, has a great deal to do with the wide toe box provided. During quick cuts, the forefoot of these shoes provides a wide base of stability which, in turn, combined with the tight-like-a-glove fit around the foot as a whole, prevents the ankle from carrying out it's usual tendency to want to roll. This is great news for people like me that need that support. I've rolled my ankle one too many times and it is NEVER a good experience. Aesthetically speaking, I honestly think the super wide toe box is very unappealing but also understand that it was probably more so designed as such for practical rather than aesthetic purposes.As alluded to previously, these shoes fit like a glove, as they say. They are almost a bit difficult to get your feet into which worried me initially. I was quickly relieved, however, to feel that although they were tight getting into, once on, they felt VERY comfortable and I feel a great deal of that was due to the fact that they provide excellent support throughout the foot.The design of this particular colorway of the shoes is not my favorite. The colors just aren't colors I typically wear and I prefer to match the color of my clothes to the color of shoes I'm wearing. But as I stated earlier, I more chose these shoes to try out the fit and feel of them and not so much the aesthetics of them. There are some pretty cool little easter eggs around the shoes if you pay attention, including a facsimile of Ja Moran't signature on the rear laterals of the uppers as well as the toe of each shoe. On the rear medials of the uppers, there seems to be some sort-of scoreboard-looking makeout of ""JA"" within a dotted grid. Ja's daughter's name ""Kaari"" can be found on the medial side of the midsoles on both shoes. One other to point out would be all of the trivia-related questions found on the rear upper of the shoes. I don't personally know a ton about Ja Morant so I was left wondering, after reading the 'family trivia' questions, where the answers to the questions might be found. I haven't been successful in finding them as of yet.The fabric and material chosen to make up these sneakers is high quality. That was one of the first things I noticed upon putting on the shoes. I wasn't expecting the leather (used on the uppers to accentuate them) to feel as high of quality as it did but I was impressed. I was a little disappointed that the the jersey-looking material found on the uppers as well was not as breathable as it appears to be. It is simply a material to give a look and perforations penetrating all the way through to where the feet are encapsulated by the shoes does not exist. Due to the tight feel of the fit, I was often led to wonder if playing basketball in them would lead to extremely sweaty feet afterwards (I haven't had the chance to play any basketball in them just quite yet).Overall, the thing I like most about these shoes is the stability and comfort that they provide. I found them to be incredibly good shoes even for just walking around in. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a good shoe to stabilize their feet during quick-cut activities such as basketball, or flag football perhaps. If I could change a couple of things about the shoe it would be the colors utilized and also perhaps the width of the toe box (simply for aesthetic purposes). Other than that, these shoes are a great product. Thanks Nike! Less"
Nike,46,117.0,2023-06-24,4.4,"For his first signature shoe, the Ja Nike team did a solid job at giving the young star a decent starting point.

It gives a je ne sais quoi feeling, but when you slide your foot in it just clicks. The collar is padded to provide plenty of stability, and the upper hugs your foot while being fairly breathable. On indoor courts I noticed the underfoot zoom unit giving me a decent amount of boost and didn't grow as weary after a couple games as I would in other pairs I've owned and tried.Where this pair falls short is the traction. Indoors, it's definitely not a grippy shoe, more so inconsistent than an outright failure. But this is where this pair shines for me, it performs great outdoors. While by no means I would say it's durable enough for a whole year, if I'm looking for a pair to last me for a summer balling outdoors, these would be it. The rubber is more than durable enough for the grind of the court. I'm not sure if I could say the same for the overlays though, the materials used on the upper work, they're nice and breathable; however, I'm not sure if leather was the best option. A rough-out nubuck would've provided plenty of durability with the grain pattern and been more abrasion resistant to the outdoor grind.While not advertised for the task, I did also try these out at the gym to give me extra stability. I can't say they performed as well as more dedicated pairs, or even just something more flat, but the stability aspect is absolutely there. And with the zoom air cushion, I wouldn't be surprised if someone used these for HIIT (though I'd pray for their mental wellbeing).The Ja 1 isn't going to be the best basketball shoe ever - nobody's first will be their best. This shoe speaks to the importance of improvement over iterations, getting better and more fine tuned with every attempt, while still maintaining that core personality. But for those looking for a pair with a great, firm fit and plenty of potential for the outdoors, this one's for them. Less"

I would rank these in that top tier along with the Kobes for overall performance. Initially, I was skeptical about the fit around the ankle as there is fair amount of padding that made it feel slightly bulky. However, unlike most other shoes, particularly basketball shoes, there were no blisters or issues associated with breaking in the shoes as a result of this extra cushioning which also provides some extra stability around the ankle. The sole has great grip and gets extra points for the cool design underneath. Despite having no visible air bubbles, the sole is incredibly comfortable and lightweight and I experienced zero issues with my arch when breaking the shoes in which is also a novelty for me. I really enjoy the shoe and it has held up very well over my initial use across HIIT classes and basketball. I look forward to continue enjoying these great basketball shoes in the future. Less"

I can’t tell, but they are very comfortable and have a lot of give when running. The laces and tongue do squeak a bit when laced tight, which some people may find annoying.One thing about the shoe I would change is the material of the swoosh. It is made of a rubbery material that wraps around the shoe from the inner swoosh to the outer swoosh. The part of the swoosh is not stitched in on the shoe, so it almost functions as a heel loop. However, I am afraid to use it like a heel loop due to the rubbery material feeling like it could snap.Overall, I really like these shoes and have worn them for both casual wear and playing basketball.

Even the nike swoosh was done in a very durable plastic like material that made it have a nice 3D appeal as it wrapped around the back. The color design scheme and attention to detail is what I enjoyed most about this shoe. I like that it gives some insight into the life of the player it represents, always nice to make those connections through a good design. The only thing I would change is the fit, because it was a snug fitting shoe. But this could probably be done by just sizing up 1/2 a size when trying on the shoe. Less"

It feels like it gives you that extra burst in your step. You still get a good amount of court feel in these shoes since the cushion isn’t overwhelming. This is a very good shoe for guards and quicker players.Design - overall I like the design! I like how the shoe is low cut, but still feels very stable. The base of the shoes is pretty wide so stability hasn’t been an issue for me thus far. The wide base paired up with the thick, padded ankle collar makes me feel nice and secure. The lockdown on the shoe is also really good! I didn’t notice any heel slippage and I didn’t roll over the footbed while making cuts or changing directions quickly. I like the personal touches on the shoe too. There are subtle details all throughout the shoe that really make it feel like Ja had a big part in the design process of his first signature shoe!Materials - the materials used are really solid in my opinion. For the price point, you can’t expect the most premium materials to be used, but these feel well built and sturdy. I imagine these will hold up well even after many hoop sessions. The padded foam tongue is nice and cushy even when tying the laces down tight. The synthetic leather on the upper part of the tongue helps to add some durability and some extra protection from wear and tear. That same synthetic leather is used in the midfoot lockdown wings to help keep you locked in when making quick movements and changing direction. The synthetic leather also overlays the mesh in the toe area for more added protection/durability. If you drag your toes while approaching the basket, that overlay should help these hold up longer than a primarily mesh shoe. The insole is quite thick and definitely adds some extra comfort. The rubber used on the bottom isn’t super tacky right out of the box, but the grooves are quite thick and feel durable as well. I’m not sure how long they’d hold up outdoors however, I guess that depends on the surface you play on. The multidirectional traction pattern performed really well for me. I didn’t notice any slipping and didn’t feel like I needed to wipe the soles all that often. Overall the materials are really solid and it feels like this shoe is built to last.Likes/dislikes - I like the low profile of the shoes. They’re not too bulky and I honestly feel like these could be rocked off the court as well. The colors on this particular pair are really fun too! They definitely pop on court. The price point is also phenomenal! This is a really good, well built basketball shoe for the price, and I love that for the accessibility of the sport! I can’t really find anything that I dislike about this shoe. Ja and Nike knocked it out of the park on this one! Less"

Shoes and the toe area felt a bit more snug for me but maybe due to first wear so it wasn’t the most comfortable experience. I would suggest to go at least half size up. With the Zoom air unit, the cushioning is decent and the phylon midsole is soft and responsive. Traction is great due to solid rubber outsole which I can see will be really good for indoor court. The reinforcement of the heel results in good ankle support. Overall it’s a solid pair of basketball shoes for the price due to great traction, good support and decent cushion. Definitely recommend go a bigger size if you have narrow feet. I plan on wearing the Ja 1 for casual wear as well as I think they look great overall. Less"

The foam sole feels very resilient and is great if you have a short commute to the office or if you are out walking around. While it is comfortable as a casual shoe, that is the farthest I would recommend for wearing this shoe in regards to activity. It most definitely is not meant for any form of exercise. The only aspect I would change with this show is attaching the tongue to the upper of the shoe a bit more on the sides. It tends to roll down to the outside of my foot as I walk, which is standard with a lot of shoes and my foot shape I think, but it would be nice to see it attached a bit better to prevent rolling. Less"

I think it's the suede and nylon uppers that make it feel more snug, in a good way. The suede and the nylon uppers, along with the exposed tongue, definitely add to the retro/nostalgia vibe. I got the black and white pair and they go with EVERYTHING. I'm thinking of picking up the grey fog/light smoke pair too.

The material is lightweight and breathable and feels like your hardly wearing anything at all but that doesn't come at the cost of comfort. The sole is very soft and feels like your walking on foam which is nice. They also fit snug around my foot which for lightweight shoes is usually a challenge as I have a long slender foot. Overall love these shoes and their price point is not bad at all."
Nike,48,160.0,2024-03-08,4.8,"Disappointed to receive these. The silver/platinum shown is photos is actually white in person. Clearly the laces look to be silver so I was thinking this sneaker would show more platinum and that's not the case at all. Let my actual photo do the ""talking"". It's a basic black & white Vomero5 with some grey details. I was going to gift this to my husband but I'll return em. These shoes are comfortable but I was definitely hoping to get what was shown in pic."
Nike,48,160.0,2024-04-03,4.8,I’m 21 and I’ve been trying to improve my sneaker game and I came across these. Very comfy first use. I usually wear a 10.5 and it fits true to size. Seems a little wider than other Nike’s. Can wear this with almost any casual fit. Haven’t seen many people wearing them so get them while you can before they hit social media and become sold out haha. Good stuff Nike
Nike,48,160.0,2024-04-05,4.8,I bought these for work. On my feet all day. Back and forth back and forth. Probably the most comfortable shoe ive had and i buy alot of shoes for work. They fit very nice. They are the lightest shoe ive worn. They fit like a glove…like you are wearing a sock. Nice cushion. I love em.
Nike,48,160.0,2024-02-03,4.8,"As a former track athlete this shoe was nostalgic. The cushion is amazing, maybe a little bouncy for some. But definitely absorbed impact and helped with jump practice. As a casual show just feels like walking on comfortable springs and giving you a bounce in each step. I say got true to size for this shoe."
Nike,48,160.0,2023-03-14,4.8,I had been looking for an NB 2002R for over a year and am glad I got these instead. I just could not find a colourway in the NB I liked but having tried them on a few times I was convinced they were my next pair as they were incredibly comfortable with just the right amount of technical detail. Then along came the V5 in this smoking colourway that goes with just about anything and they're equally as comfortable as the 2002R. I went up a half size as I always do with Nike but didn't need to as the toe box has plenty of room for a normal or slighter wider foot. Order your regular size...from size?
Nike,48,160.0,2024-04-17,4.8,"I honestly never thought Id find a shoe I consider more comfortable than the Adidas Ultraboost DNA. Well, I was wrong. These shoes look incredible and they are by far the most comfortable shoe Ive ever worn and Im a big sneaker head. So props to Nike on this one."
Nike,48,160.0,2023-09-28,4.8,"Been seeing a lot of these on feet as well as my friends always talking about getting these. And I figured why not try it out, and wow do these shoes not disappoint. Love how comfy they are and they go with a lot of my outfits. Definitely recommend getting these as an everyday pair"
Nike,48,160.0,2023-10-16,4.8,Color in the picture doesnt totally match the actual color of the shoe. StockX should do a better job matching them together so the consumer knows what they're buying. Overall I'm decently impressed but the shoe is way more white than I was anticipating.
Nike,48,160.0,2019-06-25,4.8,"I got both the white and black pairs on sale and great first impressions. No break-in time after walking 3 miles straight out the box. The combination of zoom air and cushlon provide plenty of cushioning without sacrificing stability. They are lighter they look, but feel durable enough to take a beating (only time will tell). They run true to size, but have a wide toe box. I wouldn't recommend these as performance running shoes, but great for all day comfort/walking. Some may think the muted tonal colors are boring (check out the SE SP if you want colors), but the shoe's design is funky enough (love the hits of 3M on the toe and heel) that they will get you noticed without being too in your face."
Nike,48,160.0,2024-01-11,4.8,The service was excellent . I had my shoes with 3 days of ordering. . First the overall look and design is awesome !!The comfort is great. I can wear these all day !!

I like the Nike Air technology in the midsoles of the shoe because it provided decent cushioning without being too mushy to walk on.Cons:>Comfort- While comfort is pretty good overall, my ankle would occasionally hit against the collar of the shoe opening. This was improved with a third party insole that I added, that gave my foot a little bit more clearance within the shoe.Additionally, I found that the shoe isn't incredibly breathable due to the shoe upper materials. being fairly non-porous.Finally, because of the material selection, the shoes can be a little bit heavy, so wearing these for extended periods of time may be a bit fatiguing. This is a bit less of a con for me because that's to be expected with non-trainer sneakers.>Shoe Traction - The soles of the shoe appear to be made out of a crepe rubber type of material, and this material could get a bit slippery when wet. This was evident when I wore these after a multiple rain storms while running some errands, and the shoes didn't have the best traction when walking on black top or concrete sidewalks. I view this as a minor con, because that's also to be expected with non-trainer sneakers. Less"

The outsole with the air unit is also thick and chunky and seems very durable as well. Solid traction pattern on the bottom too!Pros/cons - overall the pros definitely outweigh the cons on this sneaker. They’re a nicely updated design to the original that seem to emphasize durability which I appreciate. My two cons on these are that the laces seem pretty thin and may not be all that durable, and the fact that they’re pretty heavy. I’d definitely recommend these as a casual lifestyle shoe and not a performance sneaker. Less"

There are some great and new patterns on the shoe and I think the solid colors (maybe a solid white) would look just a bit better on these shoes. That being said, the vibrant colors are part of what makes the shoe so special, so who knows.FabricThe shoes do seem to be fantastic quality. The sole is solid and the perfect material. The fabric on top (I don't know what it's called, but it's brown on my pair) is soft and feels high quality. The inside of the shoe feels the perfect combination of comfortable, plush, and sturdy. Nothing on the shoe feels cheap at all. I do think these shoes would hold up quite well. The laces seem to be great quality too.What I LikeFirst, I like the quality of the shoe. I can tell they will hold up for a long time and that they are just generally sturdy. I LOVE the colors on the shoe and the patterns created on the front. They seem fun, vibrant, and different.What I Would ChangeI don't like the gum sole. The shoe has so many colors going on (which is great!) but I think the gum sole isn't really appropriate. I just can't help but think the shoes would look so much better if the gum was replaced with white. To me, the gum just makes them feel more like boots or utility shoes. I know that there are many who love the gum though, so it may just be personal preference. I also don't love how chunky the toe box is. I think if the toe box was a bit more rounded and a bit less blocky the shoes would be a bit sleeker. I have never designed sneakers before though! These may be things that sound better in my head but wouldn't actually look better when I saw them in real life. Less"

These are good for all-day wear with no foot fatigue that I can tell.They did crease in the toe area, just in front of the suede trim after the first day of wear, but nothing that would be a deal-breaker. The color has different hues of off white. Though subjective, I like the contrasting rubber sole and lower trim.All in all, I really like these shoes for a casual, comfortable look."

I wear a 9.5 in the Nike Free RN, Nike Pegasus, and Nike Cortez. So, I ordered a 9.5. they were slightly narrow on the width, and at least a half size too long. Not to mention the overall cushion seems to be lacking. All this in mind I am returning them.

The box alone was damage, ripped and sealed together with sellotape.I have then looked at the trainers and the same issue has occurred. The stitching was coming away on one trainer and the glue was very visible at the front where the sole meets the fabric, like they have been sent back before, re-glued then sold on again. This has been the issue with each pair of these trainers I have bought.I would not recommend buying these trainers every time I have bought them they have been poor quality / faultyThis is a real shame as I really like the trainers but I have ... MoreI have bought these trainers from a few stores and the last place I tried was Very.

Nike,51,88.0,2021-07-11,4.4,"This shoes have absolutely no breathability. I went out to run errands once and my feet were on fire and super sweaty! I've never had a workout sneaker with this problem before. Definitely a disappointment but since I bought them mostly for inside weight training I kept them. The front is already kind of falling apart after 3 weeks, they're definitely low quality. Would do not recommend, especially if you plan to work out outside. I'll happily pay 2x to have a comfortable, more durable shoe."
Nike,51,88.0,2023-02-15,4.4,"I ordered a uk 8.5 and uk 6 us 8.5 arrived in a UK 8.5 box. I will obviously return however it is extremely annoying that there is no actual customer service representatives available to email or talk to about this. Obviously when these go back in to stock they will be restocked as UK 8.5 as that’s what it says on the box and these trainers will continue to be sold incorrectly, it’s seems nobody has bothered to check. Very disappointed in ASOS for this."
Nike,51,88.0,2021-02-23,4.4,"They're Nike and they are Legends. They live up to their name. They look great. The vibrant colours and details stand out. Comfortable and the soles are cushioned. Great quality however to me they are a little on the thin side. Breathable and more like running trainers but still weatherproof and warm. I bought a 9.5 which is usually a perfect fit for me in trainers, however these are a little bit snug I would go .5 higher than your usual size."
Nike,51,88.0,2021-08-02,4.4,"Every Nike product (soft material, non-leather) has torn and been left useless after very limited indoor use at the gym for weightlifting. The material has torn on 3 pairs of Tessens. One pair lasted less than 90 days. I've bought four pairs in the last two and a half years. I hope this purchase proves otherwise. I buy them for style and comfort but as a consumer I'm getting tired of throwing my money away."
Nike,51,88.0,2022-06-19,4.4,Really amazing price on a really sweet shoe! The white ones look extra crisp and give a squeaky clean feeling when you have them on. They arrived really fast and right on point! The size does feel like it runs a bit short but maybe it's just me. I would definitely buy these again if had the chance.
Nike,51,88.0,2021-05-03,4.4,"Bought as a gym training shoe for my basketball training. Really supportive and well fitting (does run slightly narrow but I have wide feet).Perfect balance of sturdiness for barbell work and comfort for movement / cardio.I also have a Metcon 4 which are brilliant for barbell work but too stiff for cardio, and a Pegasus which are great for cardio but awful for barbell work.So these are perfect. Also, they look brilliant as they have that Nike Air feel to them."
Nike,51,88.0,2023-06-15,4.4,"The shoes fit very well. They are comfortable on my feet. Not to loose like some other brand. Good buy for the money, if this wasn't true then I wouldn't be giving this review."
Nike,51,88.0,2021-03-09,4.4,I thought they were ok for appearance and comfort. I was correct. Run a Little wide but I was willing to just keep them. They are very comfortable. I wore them for the first time today walking around the track of a park. The back heel of the shoe already appears bent and I only walked. I only wear Nike sneakers. Very disappointed.
