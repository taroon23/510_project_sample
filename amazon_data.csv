Under Armour,2024-04-07,"I was replacing a pair of Sketchers sneakers I hated from the time I bought them. I visited multiple brand shoe stores in the Rehobeth Beach area, but couldn’t find any in extra wide width. I viewed multiple shoes and brands on Amazon’s site and took a chance on these. They arrived on a timely manner, actually earlier than promised. They are well made and top quality at a fair price. At first I was disappointed as they were too snug and considered returning them. I realized I needed to loosen the laces all the way down to allow a better fit and feel. Once I did that, and went on my daily 2 mile walk, the shoes broke in nicely and the fit is fine now. The collar around the ankle also appeared, at first, to be too bulky, but, with the daily wear, it too loosened, and I now have a comfortable and stylish sneaker. Mine are the gray with the synergy green highlights."

These shoes have proven to be a game-changer in my running routine, offering exceptional comfort, support, and durability. First and foremost, the level of comfort these shoes provide is unmatched.

Under Armour,2024-03-25,Very nice. Light as a feather. Comfortable.  Recommended!!!
Under Armour,2024-04-12,"My teen son's favorite pair of shoes so far (and he killed MANY pairs). They are super comfy, good support, sturdy. So far he has worn them for 2 months and they still look and feel great! Ordered Wide - maybe that's why he's extra comfortable in them. Recommend!"
Under Armour,2024-04-02,"Great fit, great price, super comfortable"
Under Armour,2024-04-12,"The Under Armour Men's Charged Assert sneakers are an absolute game-changer! I've put these shoes through their paces, and they've exceeded my expectations on every front. Comfort? Check. Breathability? Double check. With their sleek design, they're not only functional but also look fantastic. Plus, the support they offer is top-notch, making them perfect for any activity, whether it's hitting the gym or running errands around town. Versatility is the name of the game here, folks. If you're in the market for a pair of sneakers that deliver in every department, look no further than the Charged Assert. Highly recommend!"
Under Armour,2024-03-15,"Bought these shoes for general use of working out and some running.  They fit great and have a very stable feel.  Sizing runs a tad small, if following the chart.  It said I was supposed to get a 10, but I got a 10.5 and they fit perfect.  Looking forward to using these in the gym!"
Under Armour,2023-12-11,"I’ve been in the market for new walking shoes for a while now and have tried on at least a dozen pairs before these. It was immediately apparent to me that these were the winning pair.Pros-Light weight but structurally strongThe heel cup is pronounced holding my foot in place nicely even when unlacedGreat shock absorptionMiddle of the road arch support, it neither pushes into my foot nor does it leave my arch floatingThe shoe widens out at the ball of the foot just right to support the sides of my feet without squeezing them.Cons-Basic insole, that’s comfortable but not as padded or advanced as other shoesLow rise ankle socks are a no no with these shoes as the heel cup I enjoy will suck your sock into the shoe and off your heel.All in all, for $40-$55 these are great shoes. They don’t even feel like you’re wearing shoes. The wife likes the look and feel so much she made me order her a woman’s pair of the same shoe. You can’t go wrong with this shoeUpdate 2/26/24 have worn these consistently and they look and feel new still. They handled a full week at Disney World averaging 25,000 steps per day at the parks. My feet were never tired or sore. No blisters chafing, or irritation from movement in the shoe because they are formed wonderfully around and behind the heel. I’m ordering a second pair for whenever these do wear out. My favorite pair of shoes in a long time. Genuinely enjoy these more than my brooks (which are still wonderful) and my ON cloud shoes which I feel are hyped much more than their actual quality and worth in my humble opinion"
Under Armour,2024-03-29,Fit as expected. Super comfortable. Durable. Stylish too! Will buy again!
Under Armour,2024-02-25,"Works great so far! Movable, comfortable, durable, good for running, jumping working, etc. Although if you don't get size wide than it's very long and thin and odd looking imo, I got regular 10.5 and then returned it to get 10.5 wide and it's much better and more normal looking."
Under Armour,2023-05-25,"I recently purchased a pair of tennis shoes for my active lifestyle, and I have been impressed with their overall performance and versatility.

Under Armour,2024-02-17,"After a lot of foot trauma of the last 53 years resulting in hallux rigidus, walking can be painful. What’s triggers it is a tight shoe with limited room for my toes. I ordered this shoe with a 4e extra wide, which provides a very large toe box. This shoe is light and is so much more comfortable than ALL my other shoes! I’m beyond excited to wear these moving forward. They seem like a quality shoe and the price was sub-$50, which is almost unheard of these days."
Under Armour,2024-04-07,Well made. Good fit and very comfortable
Under Armour,2024-03-05,Fits kind off loose and need to be tied snugg for more active activities. Very comfortable around and especially under the foot. Like walking on clouds. I would not use them for serious running but feels and looks great for active brisk walking.
Under Armour,2024-03-24,"Bought these because my Nike running shoes would squeak with every step and it was really annoying. After putting them on they felt REALLY GOOD, plus they have 4E wide which is amazing. After 8 months of use I haven’t once rolled my ankle (which is something I would do in my Nikes every 2-3 days) just bought the assert 10 recently and same exact quality as the last generation. Also got my mom and brother into buying a pair as well. 11/10 great shoe."
Under Armour,2022-08-04,"Uneven sole, thank you for making my foot hurt."
Under Armour,2022-09-23,"In one month shoes got torn. I never seen any other brand shoes ever get torn on top part of the shoes. Very disappointing with under armor brand.Usually, shoes get ripped off on front bottom part. In this case it torn on top part of shoes."
Under Armour,2023-05-21,"Hold on to your socks, folks, because these black Under Armor athletic shoes are about to knock your feet off!

Under Armour,2023-09-03,"Muy bien calzado, cómodo, flexible..."
Under Armour,2023-07-12,No long-term fatigue when wearing these great running shoes. You wont be disappointed!
Under Armour,2024-02-26,"Received as Xmas gift, fit was worse the more you wear.  I can no longer return and under armor will not assist with this product.  Price was great but fit and very hard rubber sole was awful"
Under Armour,2023-08-16,La talla y la calidad están bien pero me enviaron un color diferente al que pedí
Under Armour,2022-09-08,Lightweight and great support.  Perfect shoes and affordable!
Under Armour,2024-03-10,"At 6’6” and 225lbs, these are great shoes for everyday wear, beaters, or really anything you need them for. They are also a great price. One thing I notice, in being a bigger guy is the cushion and insoles wearing out really fast, especially being that I have a really high arch and wide foot.After two months, they still look and feel great, with showing just regular wear being I’ve worn them pretty much everyday, all day. Something else I’ve also been really impressed with is the outsole holding up nicely. Very little wear and tear, and has great traction.The feel of the shoe is on the firmer side, not necessarily hard, just a very comfortable and firm feel. It’s also really nice that they are wide. Regular width shoes just don’t work for me anymore.Haven’t worn Under Armour in 15+ years, and that was back in my baseball days. Definitely worth the price, and in my view, way better than shoes that typically cost $120+ that wear out very quickly."
Under Armour,2024-03-08,"These are great for wide feet. Fit well, comfortable, this is my 4th pair of these. They are a little lighter green than the in the photo but it’s no big deal, they look great"
Under Armour,2023-11-12,"Standard for all my reviews: When reviewing products, I always remain objective and honest about the product or service. I always review with information that I feel others would like to know about the product as I always assume what I'm writing will influence for or against the purchase. I always try to go above and beyond surface characteristics and input into quality, value and application. Most importantly, I will always end the review with an answer as to whether I'd purchase the product again which I believe is the most critical question pertaining to the item. To manufacturers: Want me to review your items, just let me know!I was looking to upgrade my shoe game because Nike has gotten so expensive recently. I really liked the simplicity of these UA shoes, good tread with a not-busy design. After receiving them I was immediately impressed with how light they are and how they feel overall. They would be a great walking shoe I think but I use Asics for that. The ONLY issue I have with these UA sneakers is that they are a little uncomfortable on the top of my foot near the tongue. I've tried loosening the laces a bit near the top and that helps but it's still a small issue. Other than that, I really like these shoes and I'm using them as my every day shoe when I'm not working out. They look great with shorts or jeans.I would actually purchase these again despite the minor discomfort issue. I'm hoping they just need to break in a bit more but it's not significant enough to keep me from purchasing them again, especially at the price point."
Under Armour,2024-03-20,Great feel and great look!  I needed the wide feet and this fit perfectly!
Under Armour,2024-04-10,"Bought these due to the price and thought why not. I tried these bad boys on as soon as they delivered and could not be happier. The inside of the shoe has a nice soft foam and they are light weight. Also, have a good look to them. Would definitely recommend."
Under Armour,2024-03-19,"I work 10 hours a day, 5 to 6 days a week and my feet get pretty sore since I’m on them for most of the day. Been wearing these for a week now and have really noticed a difference. And also they have good breath ability my feet don’t sweat."
Under Armour,2024-03-05,"How is this a running shoe when it has No ankle support, really low cut and instep hurts--It seems to be a common issue-- tongue too tight on top of foot, etc.I did casual brisk walking in my neighborhood for cardo.I bought this so that my Nike Air Max wouldn't depreciate as much, this was to be my daily wear shoeI don't have hilly high or uneven ground, yet my hip, ankles, knees seem to hurt as a result of wearing thisI won't climb 4 flights of stairs with thisOnly will use to walk at a regular place to and fro what's a short trip like to the nearby post office and back"
Under Armour,2024-03-29,These are light weight and help an amputee walking on prostheses to maintain their balance. As a prosthetic user certain shoes can throw off their gait when walking. Once a shoe is determined it will work well you don’t want to change the shoes. This style offers a variety of colors to be able to wear different ones without changing the way an amputees gait is compromised.
Under Armour,2024-04-04,Good looks and a wider toe box for great comfort and style.
Under Armour,2024-03-24,Size is accurate. They are comfortable. And make great basketball shoes.
Under Armour,2024-04-03,Great fit and feels like walking on air.
Under Armour,2024-02-29,"I love these. Comfortable, masculine and sexy looking shoes. Perfect for the gym or wherever. Good quality!"
Under Armour,2024-04-05,I bought these for my son and he is flat-footed and wears orthotics.  The sneaker gave him good support and was comfortable.  Very affordable as well.
Under Armour,2024-02-26,I had this pair originally and liked it so much that I ended up buying another pair after wearing my other ones out. I had the previous pair for a year or on a regular basis. They were very comfortable. Very durable and held up to all four seasons. I like them so much I ended up buying the exact same pair a year later
Under Armour,2024-04-12,No complaints. Perfect fit! Looks are awesome! Fits are right on! Size is perfect with room to spare.
Under Armour,2024-03-04,"Nothing to say, nice confortable pair of shoes, nice quality also as far as I can tell."
Under Armour,2024-03-06,I usually wear a 9.5 and they were too small so I went up to a 10 and they fit great. They are comfortable and light weight. I like the medium gray and they are easy to clean.
Under Armour,2024-03-16,Product fit as expected. I don’t know what other reviewers were talking about when they said they ran small.  Very comfortable to run and lift in at the gym.
Under Armour,2024-04-02,"This shoe is extremely lightweight and comfortable,this is my 2nd pair just a different color."
Under Armour,2024-03-10,"Well constructed, comfortable and small so I gave them to my son with a slightly smaller foot."
Under Armour,2024-04-03,"These shoes are lightweight, I was expecting a bit more breathable given the mesh fabric but that doesn't seem to be the case.Also there may be quality issues my left shoe fits tighter than the right one 😔"
Under Armour,2024-03-22,These are very comfortable. They came rather quick and I am pleased.I live near an UA outlet and I still can't find some particular shoes I previously had but Amazon never Fails me
Under Armour,2024-02-27,"I can't believe Under Armour would put their name on such a disgraceful product like the Men's Charged Surge 4 Running Shoe. Let me start by saying that I didn't even bother wearing them after inspecting the quality. The materials used in these shoes are cheap beyond belief. It's like they were made from the lowest grade of materials they could find.The soles are not even rubber as one would expect from a reputable brand like Under Armour. No, they're made of flimsy plastic that feels like it would disintegrate after a single run. It's absolutely shameful that a company with such a well-known name would attach it to something so subpar.Save yourself the embarrassment of wearing these shoes and the disappointment of wasting your money. Under Armour should be ashamed of themselves for putting out such a shoddy product. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for your running shoe needs."
Under Armour,2024-04-02,Love them
Under Armour,2024-02-29,"I'm typically a 6.5 in running/tennis shoes. Ordered in my normal size and the shoe fits a little more snug than I prefer, but not so snug they are unwearable. If I were to repurchase, I'd order a 1/2 size up. The color is exactly as expected and the shoe is light and has the right amount of cushion without being unsupportive."
Under Armour,2024-03-16,"I read several articles about the best shoes for dance aerobics and similar, and these and one other under armour shoe were listed in several recommendations.  When I saw how inexpensive they were (if you don't care which color, it seems at least one is always on sale), I thought there was no way they would be high quality, but then again, at that price it was low risk, so I ordered a pair in my usual size.  I found them to fit a little small, which I have never experienced with any of my other athletic shoes, but I felt like the fit was good otherwise so I returned and sized up half a size.I immediately liked them on first use (in an aerobics class, with dancing, jumping, etc. on a hard studio floor), and they are now my dedicated workout studio shoes.  I've worn them for several types of workouts and they are still outperforming and heir price point and holding up really nicely (holding up better than my altras that I run in which were three times the price).  They are supportive and have structure and still have some (but not too much) cushion.  I've not even swapped out the insert which I've done for other shoes. These are one of the cheapest pairs of athletic shoes I've ever owned and have definitely given me a positive opinion of UA."
Under Armour,2024-03-14,When I first got these they were giving STIFF and suffocation but now they feel so roomy and comfortable on my feet. I really like them for work and the gym. They stay looking so clean through the rain and all and they actually look cute on me.
Under Armour,2024-02-26,"I like this style for light indoor works outs and casual all day wear. I originally ordered my normal size of 7 1/2, but they were way too snug on my toes. I returned those and got a size 8. They are a bit wider than I prefer at that size, but still comfortable and snug."
Under Armour,2024-04-06,"I work retail and I am on my feet a lot! These shoes are amazing and comfortable. It feels like I’m barefoot. Awesome support. I’m a little over a year post operation from an Achilles repair, and my feet never hurt at the end of the day. They are more expensive but totally worth it. Can’t put a price on comfort"
Under Armour,2024-02-29,So the shoes are comfy as far as space. I dont have wide feet so the regular size fit perfect. I will say they are very uncomfortable to stand in. I wear them to school and don't even stand that long and my feet were HURTING! So these are not for standing for long periods of time and maybe its just me.
Under Armour,2024-03-11,"The shoes are incredibly comfortable, breathable and durable. The color is exactly as described and are true to size."
Under Armour,2024-03-30,"I will preface this by saying I have had these UA purple tennies a while ( almost a year)? & STILL LOVE them.  I do dance aerobics a lot &/ or walk at least 3-5 miles a day.  I wear size 7 and have neither a very wide, or narrow foo- just let nda normal.  The shoes, I feel, are well made, super comfy ( my 3rd pair of Under Armor... And the color purple are everything I had hoped for.  You can see me coming - that's for sure.I'm a fan... Get 'em.  ( And no sponsorship here). Btw"
Under Armour,2024-03-17,These are good shoes for my son. They are comfortable and affordable.
Under Armour,2024-04-03,"My 7 year old wears these shoes and they have held up well over the past few months! We've tried some other Amazon shoes that fell apart in a couple months, but I've been happy with the quality for the price and will plan to get these again in the future!"
Under Armour,2024-04-12,My son thought they are very comfy and loved the look
Under Armour,2024-04-15,Fit my daughter perfect. She says they’re comfortable. We appreciate the wide toe box compared to other brands. Would buy again
Under Armour,2024-04-11,"Stiff upon arrival but hoping they break in soon. Nice shoe, not too heavy. Son loves the black on black design. Would purchase again!"
Under Armour,2024-04-06,My son is very active and doesn’t take care of anything. A little cleaning and these look brand new. They can take a beating and will still be his go to shoe.
Under Armour,2024-04-11,Perfect fit every time.
Under Armour,2024-03-04,These shoes look good and also feel very comfortable. Great for a teen who’s always on the go and into sports.
Under Armour,2024-01-28,"Purchased the Under Armour Men's Yard Low Turf Baseball Cleat Shoe, and it's a game-changer.

Under Armour,2024-03-29,very tight fit and has good grip
Under Armour,2024-04-01,They fit great and look great too
Under Armour,2024-03-13,"The most comfortable turf show I’ve worn, and I’ve worn a lot over the years. Hands down the best ones I’ve had. My teammates bought themselves these exact ones. High comfort level, durable."
Under Armour,2024-03-15,"This is my son’s second pair. Fantastic tread, great fit, and he loves the color way."
Under Armour,2024-02-14,My husband coaches our son’s baseball team and we play year around. He wanted a new set of coaches shoes as he called them. Reasonably priced since all sneakers are expensive these days. But they look good on and he wears them every practice and game so they must be comfy!
Under Armour,2024-02-14,"Excellent Fit. I have the same brand running shoes, therefore I felt confident that the sizing would be correct for my feet. It was.  I had a problem in the past making an assumption that the sizing for all the manufacturers would be the same. They aren’t. I learned that the hard way. Not much difference but enough to.be uncomfortable."
Under Armour,2023-11-02,"I bought these because we started playing in a new slow pitch softball league with a turf infield. They were more comfortable than I thought they'd be, and gave great grip on the turf, and surprisingly great grip while I played int he outfield which had regular grass. I even took them once to use to play golf and they were fantastic.Only downfall is that the inserts are glued in. So if you want to swap out your inserts, you have to tear them out. I decided to keep them in because they were glued, and I was pleasantly surprised at how good the shoes felt."
Under Armour,2024-02-19,"Price and the shoe looks great, very comfortable"
Under Armour,2024-03-12,"Very comfortable and responsive, high quality shoes. Love them so far!"
Under Armour,2023-12-23,True to fit and comfortable.
Under Armour,2024-03-23,"I recently went back to running. I trained and ran back to back races with these shoes and these are one of the most comfortable shoes i ever used. I feel like UA for me is hit or miss and this is definitely a hit. It’s light, it doesn’t feel like it’s messing with my strides, and bonus is it’s almost a built-in warning to drivers on the road (I bought the hot pink-ish one on a whim haha)."
Under Armour,2023-12-31,I bought these for my younger brother's birthday. He absolutely loves them! They're the first pair of shoes he's ever had where he tried on and they fit perfectly and they're very comfortable.
Under Armour,2023-11-20,"Comfortable, light"
Under Armour,2023-12-29,Muy bonitos y cómodos
Under Armour,2023-08-31,"Ive got plantar fasciitis, both left and right. These fit great and are true to size. I need shoes to be a little tighter, as I tend to get injured more with even a little extra room. Comfy so far. I do worry about the stitching long term, but time will tell."
Under Armour,2024-01-30,These shoes are used for youth basketball and do a wonderful job on the court while also looking “cool”. The black and gold coke combo make them sleek and modern. The fit is true to size and have a comfortable sole.
Under Armour,2024-02-12,"Great show.  As soon as my son put them on he loved them.  Great quality & look for the price. Fits great, looks great with everything. Definitely recommend."
Under Armour,2024-04-15,My boy loves these they fit perfect as ordered
Under Armour,2024-03-06,My 7 year old son love these pair of shoes.. he's petite so 12.5 kid size fits perfect for everyday use. He said it's comfy so that sounds great to me.
Under Armour,2024-02-11,Awesome shoe but does run small in size. My daughter wears a 5 and thank goodness I got her a 6 cause they are snug! Good ankle support and durable
Under Armour,2024-01-31,I bought these for my 9 yo for Basketball season. He loves them so much he wants to wear them to school every day. They are all leather and I know will hold up well! Hes says they are very comfortable and more supportive than his every day shoes. This picture is nearly daily use after 1 month!
Under Armour,2024-04-06,My daughter loves these basketball sneakers. She said they're very comfortable and easy move in when she's on the court. The colors are cool and stylish.
Under Armour,2024-04-01,very good
Under Armour,2024-01-06,They are comfy and the color is nice and bright. Exactly what I was looking for.
Under Armour,2024-02-21,"I bought these for my daughter for Christmas. She loved them, and said they are SUPER comfy for running, walking, and working out. Good choice of shoes!!!"
Under Armour,2023-09-24,Although I got them in a size too small I still wear them and they’re as comfy as can be. Really don’t see the green in them as much as I see it as grey but they’re still cute and comfortable.
Under Armour,2023-09-24,Excelente zapato
Under Armour,2023-10-21,Tienes que pedir medio número más de ti talla xq viene reducida
Under Armour,2023-10-22,"If you like this brand, I would recommend these shoes. They are comfortable and cute. The only issue I have is the toe box seems narrow, but I have only worn them twice. I will purchase more when I can get them for the same price or less than I paid for this pair."
Under Armour,2024-03-21,"I wore this sneakers all day and didn't feel a bit of discomfort,  was light arch support , great buy no regrets.  I went up a size to be sure and I'm glad I did"
Under Armour,2022-11-15,"They were a bit narrow, I would have liked more room for my pinky toe. They're just not as roomy as I'd like. They're pretty flat and not very cushy. But the arch is good. They'll do."
Under Armour,2024-04-08,"I've quite a few UA clothing that I wanted an athletic sneaker to match my joggers. This sneaker is comfortable, durable and fits great. I recommend this UA sneaker."
Under Armour,2024-04-09,Comfortable and have enough support.
Under Armour,2024-04-06,These shoes are amazing. I have worn themEveryday exclusively since spraining my2nd ankle in 9 months. Comfortable and supportive - I have stepped off the curb wrong but didn't sprain my ankle while wearing these!!!! Since they are all black I wear them even at work with dress pants.
Under Armour,2024-04-02,"I absolutely love the look of these! They’re really cute and even cuter when I wore them. I bought my normal shoe size, they’re a bit snug so I wish I would have went up a half size. I kept them and still find them comfortable. I did get a blister after the first time I wore them but haven’t since. If you tend to wear thicker socks with your tennis shoes I would definitely go up at least a half size. Other than the sizing I love them!"
Under Armour,2024-03-25,Very comfortable and they fit perfectly!
Under Armour,2024-04-14,"I wore these suckers for 5 days straight at Disney, with 2 of the days being around 25,000 steps. Not a single blister in sight and my feet were tired but not in pain. Highly recommend these for walking. For running they aren’t quite enough cushion for me, but walking is perfect!"
Under Armour,2024-03-18,These fit perfectly and are exactly as pictured. They are comfortable and fit well. I would definitely purchase again
Under Armour,2024-03-28,"Best fitting sneakers that I've had in a long time. Good cushioning on insole, and good arch support."
Under Armour,2024-02-05,"Fit well, has held up well also."
Under Armour,2024-03-23,Great shoes
Under Armour,2024-01-31,These shoes are great quality Under Armour shoes!! I had to change sizes for my daughter and had no problem getting the refund and buying a bigger size. The shoes are light weight and look exactly like the pictures.
Under Armour,2023-09-03,Great shoes sizing runs a bit small though!
Under Armour,2023-10-15,Fit percent and at a great price. Very durable and comfy
Under Armour,2023-09-22,"The shoes are as expected.  The sizing was correct and my son enjoys them.  As far as quality goes, the middle strip on the one tongue started to fray pretty badly after a couple of weeks but it's only a small strip."
Under Armour,2024-01-28,they  are good
Under Armour,2023-08-15,The shoe ran way too small . My child just out grew a size  6 with a bit of wiggle room left. I bought the next half size up. The 6 1/2 was smaller and tighter than the size 6  from the same shoe company.  If I bought a whole size up then the shoe would be to big. It ran small  in the toe area and side of the shoe. My son has a narrow foot but this was way to small
Under Armour,2024-02-29,"Exactly as I expected, the sneakers are awesome, very comfortable, I'm really happy with this purchase."
Under Armour,2024-02-16,well designed shoe
Under Armour,2024-04-02,"I don't think these are serious running shoes. I did try to use them that way, but they didn't seem to offer much in the way of stability. So overall, I think they're no better than four star. Because they're more running shoe in style than the real thing. Or maybe it's just preference. I prefer running shoes that have very little sole to them. In any case, I picked these up to use as comfortable work shoes. I work in a facility with a concrete floor and it's helpful to have a little cushioning. I""ve found that these do the job very well. And they weren't very expensive. For that purpose they're more than suitable and I recommend them."
Under Armour,2024-03-11,"I own a significant number of shoes of various styles, purposes, and brand names; however, this is my first pair of Under Armour shoes.  A few specific thoughts:- The fit is VERY accurate.  I wear a size 10½, but often have to order up a half size due to narrowly made shoes, but that is not the case with these.  The 10½ pair that I received fits perfectly in every regard.- These are extremely comfortable shoes.  It is not an exaggeration to say that these are the most comfortable running shoes that I have ever worn.- These shoes are as light as you would expect running shoes to be.  They are certainly lighter than the pair that they replaced and also lighter than the pair that I owned before those.Overall, these are great shoes and I highly recommend them!"
Under Armour,2024-03-25,"Purchased these for my dad and he loves them, he said they're are very comfortable to work in as a mover and fits him very well."
Under Armour,2024-02-27,"Great pair of shoes for running, walking or daily wear.These shoes are comfortable with a roomy toe box.  In a perfectly fit pair of shoes I wear size 10.5.  The ones I ordered are 10.5 and they fit... perfectly.  These shoes, unlike some, run true to size.  This is important when ordering online (i.e. you can't try them on).The insole is well cushioned and the main sole is absorbent to the shocks, stones, bouncing around you encounter while exercising.  The fabric of the shoe is several layers of firm but flexible mesh and is very breathable.  The tread has a semi aggressive pattern for varying surfaces.  The tread is very nice in that it has good grip, but is unlikely to pick up gravel or debris very easily.A quality pair of running shoes, well designed, comfortable, versatile."
Under Armour,2024-03-01,"I got these for my son to wear as a tennis shoe to school. He likes the colors and says they are very comfortable. They do not mark floors. If I could only keep him from getting them so dirty. I bought a 1/2 size up from what he needs so that he could grow into them some. He's only 12 and already wearing a size 10.5, he's going to be a giant. UA shoes have always fit him well as he needs a little bit wider of a foot/toe box. They strings tie well and do not come undone. These shoes would do well for any type of active lifestyle or activity. They seem like they will last him until he outgrows them."
Under Armour,2024-03-04,These are extremely comfortable and light weight. They look amazing and are easy to slip on and off.Looks-These look amazing and will go with almost any outfit.-They are a jet black which will help me keep them looking cleaner for a longer time-The sole goes up a little higher than my other sneakersComfort-I wear insoles on my shoes but tried these on without them and they are so comfortable.-The original insole is soft and the best part is that it doesn't peel off so easily-The shoelaces are thicker than normal shoelaces which make it so I can tie them tight and not have to worry about them digging into my foot-The heal of the shoe has a higher support which for me is super important since I will be using these for running.Con- They squeak when they get wet specially in the basketball court
Under Armour,2024-04-05,"My nine year old son loves these. He just got them yesterday, so I cannot speak for long term. But he liked them right out of the box. He says they are very comfortable to run and play in. I’ll update my review again in a month or so."
Under Armour,2024-03-18,Got as a gift for my grandson.
Under Armour,2024-04-10,Bought these for my son. He said they are very comfortable. I like the style of the shoe. These are his 2nd pair. I bought the white and black ones last year. Would buy again.
Under Armour,2024-03-28,They fit well & are durable for an active child
Under Armour,2024-03-25,"It's taken me over 2 different sizes to get my son shoes for school. He wears a size 6 in all the shoes ive bought him Target, Walmart or a shoe store. I even started with a 6.5 with Under Armour, he couldn't even put his foot in the shoes, went to a size 7 big kid. His toe was up against the tip of the shoe and still too tight. I will try an 8 big kid and see how this goes.  But these shoes run 2 to 3 sizes small."
Under Armour,2024-03-31,"So UA is pretty popular and historically their products are durable. We got these as part of the try before you buy since the last pair we bought ran small. These appear to run true to size but are not holding up in comparison to the competition.After 2 times being worn (albeit brief times), the shoe soles are already starting to break down and show wear.This style (or maybe I just got a bad batch?) just doesn’t stand up to their normal quality products."
Under Armour,2024-03-24,I wanted to love these shoes. The white on the sole was too big for my liking and it made them seem clunky. The rest of the shoe looked great. I wore them walking around for a few hours and my arches hurt. I have other shoes of this brand so it was definitely just this style.
Under Armour,2024-04-11,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 We love, love love these! I bought my daughter the iridescent pair! They're so beautiful! She said they are super comfortable and fit her feet true to the size! These feel very well made and like their going to be long lasting. I was trying to find her a durable pair! She plays so hard and runs through shoes very fast. I decided to give these a shot. They seem to fit very well and did I mention how dang cute these are 😍😍 lol highly recommend! Plus they were a very fair price, inexpensive."
Under Armour,2024-04-11,"My son absolutely loves his Under Armour Boys' Assert 10 shoes! They're comfortable, durable, and the alternate closure makes them easy for him to put on and take off by himself. With vibrant colors and a sleek design, they're not only stylish but also supportive for his active lifestyle. Without a doubt, these are the best shoes he's ever had"
Under Armour,2024-04-11,"These are perfect for my 4 year old! Comfy, easy to wash and last so much longer than others. We have had issues with the Velcro coming off in the past but these ones are still holding up great"
Under Armour,2024-03-08,My daughter says these are the most comfortable shoes she owns. Love that they come in wide.
Under Armour,2024-03-19,"I came across these shoes because I was looking for something with a wide fit for my child. Regular shoes do not fit him, and I wanted to find something comfortable for him but could not find many options with a wide fit. The wide fit did provide some additional room and made getting the shoes on easier, but the Velcro strap is hanging on to dear life as there is not enough Velcro to hold on to and the strap keeps falling off. I'll have to get some Velcro to add to his shoe to prevent this. Other than that, good fit and he says it's very comfortable."
Under Armour,2024-04-06,"These shoes held up amazingly well.  My daughter wears them daily for school, all day. There are no rips or tears. The tread is still good.  They have lasted all but the last 6 weeks of school because she outgrew them!  We are buying a new pair today!  Very satisfied!"
Under Armour,2024-03-22,My 8 year old loves to run and wears the tread out quickly. Bought these for him and they are lasting awhile and are very comfortable.
Under Armour,2024-03-01,"My daughter loves them, they are true to size and excellent quality"
Under Armour,2024-04-07,"I was replacing a pair of Sketchers sneakers I hated from the time I bought them. I visited multiple brand shoe stores in the Rehobeth Beach area, but couldn’t find any in extra wide width. I viewed multiple shoes and brands on Amazon’s site and took a chance on these. They arrived on a timely manner, actually earlier than promised. They are well made and top quality at a fair price. At first I was disappointed as they were too snug and considered returning them. I realized I needed to loosen the laces all the way down to allow a better fit and feel. Once I did that, and went on my daily 2 mile walk, the shoes broke in nicely and the fit is fine now. The collar around the ankle also appeared, at first, to be too bulky, but, with the daily wear, it too loosened, and I now have a comfortable and stylish sneaker. Mine are the gray with the synergy green highlights."
Under Armour,2024-01-10,"If you're on the lookout for a pair of sneakers that blend style, comfort, and performance seamlessly, look no further than the Under Armour Men's Charged Assert 10.

Under Armour,2023-07-19,"I recently purchased a pair of Under Armour running shoes and I am extremely impressed with their performance. These shoes have proven to be a game-changer in my running routine, offering exceptional comfort, support, and durability. First and foremost, the level of comfort these shoes provide is unmatched. The cushioning system incorporated in the midsole ensures a plush and responsive feel that absorbs impact effectively. It aids in minimizing fatigue, allowing me to push harder and longer during my runs. The padded collar and tongue also contribute to a snug fit and enhanced ankle support, preventing any discomfort or rubbing. Stability and support are paramount for any running shoe, and this is where Under Armour shines. The combination of a solid outsole with excellent traction and a well-constructed upper provides exceptional stability. These shoes offer a secure fit, preventing any slips or movements that could lead to injury. My foot feels locked in place, enabling me to confidently tackle different terrains and maintain a consistent pace. Durability is another aspect that stood out to me. Despite intense use on various surfaces, the shoe's construction has remained intact and shows no signs of wear. The high-quality materials used in the upper, midsole, and outsole are undoubtedly built to last. This long-lasting reliability ensures that the shoes will serve me well for many miles to come. Moreover, the sleek design of the Under Armour running shoes is worth mentioning. Its aesthetic appeal is a bonus, as these shoes look stylish and modern while offering high functionality. The brand's attention to detail is evident in the thoughtful design, making these shoes suitable for both running and everyday wear. In conclusion, Under Armour running shoes have exceeded my expectations in terms of comfort, support, and durability. They provide a comfortable running experience, superb stability, and impressive longevity.

They will undoubtedly enhance your running performance and keep you going mile after mile."
Under Armour,2024-03-25,Very nice. Light as a feather. Comfortable.  Recommended!!!
Under Armour,2024-04-12,"My teen son's favorite pair of shoes so far (and he killed MANY pairs). They are super comfy, good support, sturdy. So far he has worn them for 2 months and they still look and feel great! Ordered Wide - maybe that's why he's extra comfortable in them. Recommend!"
Under Armour,2024-04-02,"Great fit, great price, super comfortable"
Under Armour,2024-04-12,"The Under Armour Men's Charged Assert sneakers are an absolute game-changer! I've put these shoes through their paces, and they've exceeded my expectations on every front. Comfort? Check. Breathability? Double check. With their sleek design, they're not only functional but also look fantastic. Plus, the support they offer is top-notch, making them perfect for any activity, whether it's hitting the gym or running errands around town. Versatility is the name of the game here, folks. If you're in the market for a pair of sneakers that deliver in every department, look no further than the Charged Assert. Highly recommend!"
Under Armour,2024-03-15,"Bought these shoes for general use of working out and some running.  They fit great and have a very stable feel.  Sizing runs a tad small, if following the chart.  It said I was supposed to get a 10, but I got a 10.5 and they fit perfect.  Looking forward to using these in the gym!"
Under Armour,2023-12-11,"I’ve been in the market for new walking shoes for a while now and have tried on at least a dozen pairs before these. It was immediately apparent to me that these were the winning pair.Pros-Light weight but structurally strongThe heel cup is pronounced holding my foot in place nicely even when unlacedGreat shock absorptionMiddle of the road arch support, it neither pushes into my foot nor does it leave my arch floatingThe shoe widens out at the ball of the foot just right to support the sides of my feet without squeezing them.Cons-Basic insole, that’s comfortable but not as padded or advanced as other shoesLow rise ankle socks are a no no with these shoes as the heel cup I enjoy will suck your sock into the shoe and off your heel.All in all, for $40-$55 these are great shoes. They don’t even feel like you’re wearing shoes. The wife likes the look and feel so much she made me order her a woman’s pair of the same shoe. You can’t go wrong with this shoeUpdate 2/26/24 have worn these consistently and they look and feel new still. They handled a full week at Disney World averaging 25,000 steps per day at the parks. My feet were never tired or sore. No blisters chafing, or irritation from movement in the shoe because they are formed wonderfully around and behind the heel. I’m ordering a second pair for whenever these do wear out. My favorite pair of shoes in a long time. Genuinely enjoy these more than my brooks (which are still wonderful) and my ON cloud shoes which I feel are hyped much more than their actual quality and worth in my humble opinion"
Under Armour,2024-03-29,Fit as expected. Super comfortable. Durable. Stylish too! Will buy again!
Under Armour,2024-02-25,"Works great so far! Movable, comfortable, durable, good for running, jumping working, etc. Although if you don't get size wide than it's very long and thin and odd looking imo, I got regular 10.5 and then returned it to get 10.5 wide and it's much better and more normal looking."
Under Armour,2023-05-25,"I recently purchased a pair of tennis shoes for my active lifestyle, and I have been impressed with their overall performance and versatility.

While they are designed primarily for tennis, they can easily be used for various other activities, such as walking, jogging, or light workouts. The shoes offer excellent traction, allowing for stability and grip on different surfaces. Whether on the tennis court or on the pavement, I feel confident in these shoes' performance.Breathability and Moisture Control:Another noteworthy aspect of these tennis shoes is their breathability. The upper mesh material allows for proper airflow, keeping my feet cool and preventing excessive sweating. This feature is particularly beneficial during intense physical activities, as it helps maintain comfort and reduces the risk of unpleasant odors.Style and Aesthetics:While performance is key, aesthetics also play a role in choosing footwear.

I recommend considering these tennis shoes for anyone in need of reliable, comfortable, and versatile footwear."
Under Armour,2024-02-17,"After a lot of foot trauma of the last 53 years resulting in hallux rigidus, walking can be painful. What’s triggers it is a tight shoe with limited room for my toes. I ordered this shoe with a 4e extra wide, which provides a very large toe box. This shoe is light and is so much more comfortable than ALL my other shoes! I’m beyond excited to wear these moving forward. They seem like a quality shoe and the price was sub-$50, which is almost unheard of these days."
Under Armour,2024-04-07,Well made. Good fit and very comfortable
Under Armour,2024-03-05,Fits kind off loose and need to be tied snugg for more active activities. Very comfortable around and especially under the foot. Like walking on clouds. I would not use them for serious running but feels and looks great for active brisk walking.
Under Armour,2024-03-24,"Bought these because my Nike running shoes would squeak with every step and it was really annoying. After putting them on they felt REALLY GOOD, plus they have 4E wide which is amazing. After 8 months of use I haven’t once rolled my ankle (which is something I would do in my Nikes every 2-3 days) just bought the assert 10 recently and same exact quality as the last generation. Also got my mom and brother into buying a pair as well. 11/10 great shoe."
Under Armour,2022-08-04,"Uneven sole, thank you for making my foot hurt."
Under Armour,2022-09-23,"In one month shoes got torn. I never seen any other brand shoes ever get torn on top part of the shoes. Very disappointing with under armor brand.Usually, shoes get ripped off on front bottom part. In this case it torn on top part of shoes."
Under Armour,2023-05-21,"Hold on to your socks, folks, because these black Under Armor athletic shoes are about to knock your feet off! These bad boys are like a covert operation for your toes, delivering stealthy comfort and style that'll make you feel like a ninja on a mission to conquer the world (or at least the neighborhood basketball court).First things first, let's talk about the blackness of these shoes. They're so black, they make the night sky jealous. It's like strapping a pair of mini black holes to your feet, ready to absorb all the attention and keep your fashion game on point.

These shoes are so cozy, it's like walking on a cloud that's been sprinkled with unicorn feathers. The moment you slip them on, you'll feel like your feet are being hugged by a squadron of baby kittens. It's a blissful experience that'll have you wondering why you haven't been wearing these shoes since birth.And the performance? Oh boy, get ready to unleash your inner sports superstar. With their advanced technology and built-in superpowers (okay, maybe not superpowers, but close enough), these shoes will have you jumping higher, running faster, and pivoting with the agility of a gazelle on roller skates. Your opponents won't know what hit them as you leave them in the dust, questioning their life choices.But wait, there's more!

Under Armour,2023-09-03,"Muy bien calzado, cómodo, flexible..."
Under Armour,2023-07-12,No long-term fatigue when wearing these great running shoes. You wont be disappointed!
Under Armour,2024-02-26,"Received as Xmas gift, fit was worse the more you wear.  I can no longer return and under armor will not assist with this product.  Price was great but fit and very hard rubber sole was awful"
Under Armour,2023-08-16,La talla y la calidad están bien pero me enviaron un color diferente al que pedí
Under Armour,2022-09-08,Lightweight and great support.  Perfect shoes and affordable!
Under Armour,2024-03-10,"At 6’6” and 225lbs, these are great shoes for everyday wear, beaters, or really anything you need them for. They are also a great price. One thing I notice, in being a bigger guy is the cushion and insoles wearing out really fast, especially being that I have a really high arch and wide foot.After two months, they still look and feel great, with showing just regular wear being I’ve worn them pretty much everyday, all day. Something else I’ve also been really impressed with is the outsole holding up nicely. Very little wear and tear, and has great traction.The feel of the shoe is on the firmer side, not necessarily hard, just a very comfortable and firm feel. It’s also really nice that they are wide. Regular width shoes just don’t work for me anymore.Haven’t worn Under Armour in 15+ years, and that was back in my baseball days. Definitely worth the price, and in my view, way better than shoes that typically cost $120+ that wear out very quickly."
Under Armour,2024-03-08,"These are great for wide feet. Fit well, comfortable, this is my 4th pair of these. They are a little lighter green than the in the photo but it’s no big deal, they look great"
Under Armour,2023-11-12,"Standard for all my reviews: When reviewing products, I always remain objective and honest about the product or service. I always review with information that I feel others would like to know about the product as I always assume what I'm writing will influence for or against the purchase. I always try to go above and beyond surface characteristics and input into quality, value and application. Most importantly, I will always end the review with an answer as to whether I'd purchase the product again which I believe is the most critical question pertaining to the item. To manufacturers: Want me to review your items, just let me know!I was looking to upgrade my shoe game because Nike has gotten so expensive recently. I really liked the simplicity of these UA shoes, good tread with a not-busy design. After receiving them I was immediately impressed with how light they are and how they feel overall. They would be a great walking shoe I think but I use Asics for that. The ONLY issue I have with these UA sneakers is that they are a little uncomfortable on the top of my foot near the tongue. I've tried loosening the laces a bit near the top and that helps but it's still a small issue. Other than that, I really like these shoes and I'm using them as my every day shoe when I'm not working out. They look great with shorts or jeans.I would actually purchase these again despite the minor discomfort issue. I'm hoping they just need to break in a bit more but it's not significant enough to keep me from purchasing them again, especially at the price point."
Under Armour,2024-03-20,Great feel and great look!  I needed the wide feet and this fit perfectly!
Under Armour,2024-04-10,"Bought these due to the price and thought why not. I tried these bad boys on as soon as they delivered and could not be happier. The inside of the shoe has a nice soft foam and they are light weight. Also, have a good look to them. Would definitely recommend."
Under Armour,2024-03-19,"I work 10 hours a day, 5 to 6 days a week and my feet get pretty sore since I’m on them for most of the day. Been wearing these for a week now and have really noticed a difference. And also they have good breath ability my feet don’t sweat."
Under Armour,2024-03-05,"How is this a running shoe when it has No ankle support, really low cut and instep hurts--It seems to be a common issue-- tongue too tight on top of foot, etc.I did casual brisk walking in my neighborhood for cardo.I bought this so that my Nike Air Max wouldn't depreciate as much, this was to be my daily wear shoeI don't have hilly high or uneven ground, yet my hip, ankles, knees seem to hurt as a result of wearing thisI won't climb 4 flights of stairs with thisOnly will use to walk at a regular place to and fro what's a short trip like to the nearby post office and back"
Under Armour,2024-03-29,These are light weight and help an amputee walking on prostheses to maintain their balance. As a prosthetic user certain shoes can throw off their gait when walking. Once a shoe is determined it will work well you don’t want to change the shoes. This style offers a variety of colors to be able to wear different ones without changing the way an amputees gait is compromised.
Under Armour,2024-04-04,Good looks and a wider toe box for great comfort and style.
Under Armour,2024-03-24,Size is accurate. They are comfortable. And make great basketball shoes.
Under Armour,2024-04-03,Great fit and feels like walking on air.
Under Armour,2024-02-29,"I love these. Comfortable, masculine and sexy looking shoes. Perfect for the gym or wherever. Good quality!"
Under Armour,2024-04-05,I bought these for my son and he is flat-footed and wears orthotics.  The sneaker gave him good support and was comfortable.  Very affordable as well.
Under Armour,2024-02-26,I had this pair originally and liked it so much that I ended up buying another pair after wearing my other ones out. I had the previous pair for a year or on a regular basis. They were very comfortable. Very durable and held up to all four seasons. I like them so much I ended up buying the exact same pair a year later
Under Armour,2024-04-12,No complaints. Perfect fit! Looks are awesome! Fits are right on! Size is perfect with room to spare.
Under Armour,2024-03-04,"Nothing to say, nice confortable pair of shoes, nice quality also as far as I can tell."
Under Armour,2024-03-06,I usually wear a 9.5 and they were too small so I went up to a 10 and they fit great. They are comfortable and light weight. I like the medium gray and they are easy to clean.
Under Armour,2024-03-16,Product fit as expected. I don’t know what other reviewers were talking about when they said they ran small.  Very comfortable to run and lift in at the gym.
Under Armour,2024-04-02,"This shoe is extremely lightweight and comfortable,this is my 2nd pair just a different color."
Under Armour,2024-03-10,"Well constructed, comfortable and small so I gave them to my son with a slightly smaller foot."
Under Armour,2024-04-03,"These shoes are lightweight, I was expecting a bit more breathable given the mesh fabric but that doesn't seem to be the case.Also there may be quality issues my left shoe fits tighter than the right one 😔"
Under Armour,2024-03-22,These are very comfortable. They came rather quick and I am pleased.I live near an UA outlet and I still can't find some particular shoes I previously had but Amazon never Fails me
Under Armour,2024-02-27,"I can't believe Under Armour would put their name on such a disgraceful product like the Men's Charged Surge 4 Running Shoe. Let me start by saying that I didn't even bother wearing them after inspecting the quality. The materials used in these shoes are cheap beyond belief. It's like they were made from the lowest grade of materials they could find.The soles are not even rubber as one would expect from a reputable brand like Under Armour. No, they're made of flimsy plastic that feels like it would disintegrate after a single run. It's absolutely shameful that a company with such a well-known name would attach it to something so subpar.Save yourself the embarrassment of wearing these shoes and the disappointment of wasting your money. Under Armour should be ashamed of themselves for putting out such a shoddy product. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for your running shoe needs."
Under Armour,2024-04-02,Love them
Under Armour,2024-02-29,"I'm typically a 6.5 in running/tennis shoes. Ordered in my normal size and the shoe fits a little more snug than I prefer, but not so snug they are unwearable. If I were to repurchase, I'd order a 1/2 size up. The color is exactly as expected and the shoe is light and has the right amount of cushion without being unsupportive."
Under Armour,2024-03-16,"I read several articles about the best shoes for dance aerobics and similar, and these and one other under armour shoe were listed in several recommendations.  When I saw how inexpensive they were (if you don't care which color, it seems at least one is always on sale), I thought there was no way they would be high quality, but then again, at that price it was low risk, so I ordered a pair in my usual size.  I found them to fit a little small, which I have never experienced with any of my other athletic shoes, but I felt like the fit was good otherwise so I returned and sized up half a size.I immediately liked them on first use (in an aerobics class, with dancing, jumping, etc. on a hard studio floor), and they are now my dedicated workout studio shoes.  I've worn them for several types of workouts and they are still outperforming and heir price point and holding up really nicely (holding up better than my altras that I run in which were three times the price).  They are supportive and have structure and still have some (but not too much) cushion.  I've not even swapped out the insert which I've done for other shoes. These are one of the cheapest pairs of athletic shoes I've ever owned and have definitely given me a positive opinion of UA."
Under Armour,2024-03-14,When I first got these they were giving STIFF and suffocation but now they feel so roomy and comfortable on my feet. I really like them for work and the gym. They stay looking so clean through the rain and all and they actually look cute on me.
Under Armour,2024-02-26,"I like this style for light indoor works outs and casual all day wear. I originally ordered my normal size of 7 1/2, but they were way too snug on my toes. I returned those and got a size 8. They are a bit wider than I prefer at that size, but still comfortable and snug."
Under Armour,2024-04-06,"I work retail and I am on my feet a lot! These shoes are amazing and comfortable. It feels like I’m barefoot. Awesome support. I’m a little over a year post operation from an Achilles repair, and my feet never hurt at the end of the day. They are more expensive but totally worth it. Can’t put a price on comfort"
Under Armour,2024-02-29,So the shoes are comfy as far as space. I dont have wide feet so the regular size fit perfect. I will say they are very uncomfortable to stand in. I wear them to school and don't even stand that long and my feet were HURTING! So these are not for standing for long periods of time and maybe its just me.
Under Armour,2024-03-11,"The shoes are incredibly comfortable, breathable and durable. The color is exactly as described and are true to size."
Under Armour,2024-03-30,"I will preface this by saying I have had these UA purple tennies a while ( almost a year)? & STILL LOVE them.  I do dance aerobics a lot &/ or walk at least 3-5 miles a day.  I wear size 7 and have neither a very wide, or narrow foo- just let nda normal.  The shoes, I feel, are well made, super comfy ( my 3rd pair of Under Armor... And the color purple are everything I had hoped for.  You can see me coming - that's for sure.I'm a fan... Get 'em.  ( And no sponsorship here). Btw"
Under Armour,2024-03-17,These are good shoes for my son. They are comfortable and affordable.
Under Armour,2024-04-03,"My 7 year old wears these shoes and they have held up well over the past few months! We've tried some other Amazon shoes that fell apart in a couple months, but I've been happy with the quality for the price and will plan to get these again in the future!"
Under Armour,2024-04-12,My son thought they are very comfy and loved the look
Under Armour,2024-04-15,Fit my daughter perfect. She says they’re comfortable. We appreciate the wide toe box compared to other brands. Would buy again
Under Armour,2024-04-11,"Stiff upon arrival but hoping they break in soon. Nice shoe, not too heavy. Son loves the black on black design. Would purchase again!"
Under Armour,2024-04-06,My son is very active and doesn’t take care of anything. A little cleaning and these look brand new. They can take a beating and will still be his go to shoe.
Under Armour,2024-04-11,Perfect fit every time.
Under Armour,2024-03-04,These shoes look good and also feel very comfortable. Great for a teen who’s always on the go and into sports.
Under Armour,2024-01-28,"Purchased the Under Armour Men's Yard Low Turf Baseball Cleat Shoe, and it's a game-changer.

Under Armour,2024-03-29,very tight fit and has good grip
Under Armour,2024-04-01,They fit great and look great too
Under Armour,2024-03-13,"The most comfortable turf show I’ve worn, and I’ve worn a lot over the years. Hands down the best ones I’ve had. My teammates bought themselves these exact ones. High comfort level, durable."
Under Armour,2024-03-15,"This is my son’s second pair. Fantastic tread, great fit, and he loves the color way."
Under Armour,2024-02-14,My husband coaches our son’s baseball team and we play year around. He wanted a new set of coaches shoes as he called them. Reasonably priced since all sneakers are expensive these days. But they look good on and he wears them every practice and game so they must be comfy!
Under Armour,2024-02-14,"Excellent Fit. I have the same brand running shoes, therefore I felt confident that the sizing would be correct for my feet. It was.  I had a problem in the past making an assumption that the sizing for all the manufacturers would be the same. They aren’t. I learned that the hard way. Not much difference but enough to.be uncomfortable."
Under Armour,2023-11-02,"I bought these because we started playing in a new slow pitch softball league with a turf infield. They were more comfortable than I thought they'd be, and gave great grip on the turf, and surprisingly great grip while I played int he outfield which had regular grass. I even took them once to use to play golf and they were fantastic.Only downfall is that the inserts are glued in. So if you want to swap out your inserts, you have to tear them out. I decided to keep them in because they were glued, and I was pleasantly surprised at how good the shoes felt."
Under Armour,2024-02-19,"Price and the shoe looks great, very comfortable"
Under Armour,2024-03-12,"Very comfortable and responsive, high quality shoes. Love them so far!"
Under Armour,2023-12-23,True to fit and comfortable.
Under Armour,2024-03-23,"I recently went back to running. I trained and ran back to back races with these shoes and these are one of the most comfortable shoes i ever used. I feel like UA for me is hit or miss and this is definitely a hit. It’s light, it doesn’t feel like it’s messing with my strides, and bonus is it’s almost a built-in warning to drivers on the road (I bought the hot pink-ish one on a whim haha)."
Under Armour,2023-12-31,I bought these for my younger brother's birthday. He absolutely loves them! They're the first pair of shoes he's ever had where he tried on and they fit perfectly and they're very comfortable.
Under Armour,2023-11-20,"Comfortable, light"
Under Armour,2023-12-29,Muy bonitos y cómodos
Under Armour,2023-08-31,"Ive got plantar fasciitis, both left and right. These fit great and are true to size. I need shoes to be a little tighter, as I tend to get injured more with even a little extra room. Comfy so far. I do worry about the stitching long term, but time will tell."
Under Armour,2024-01-30,These shoes are used for youth basketball and do a wonderful job on the court while also looking “cool”. The black and gold coke combo make them sleek and modern. The fit is true to size and have a comfortable sole.
Under Armour,2024-02-12,"Great show.  As soon as my son put them on he loved them.  Great quality & look for the price. Fits great, looks great with everything. Definitely recommend."
Under Armour,2024-04-15,My boy loves these they fit perfect as ordered
Under Armour,2024-03-06,My 7 year old son love these pair of shoes.. he's petite so 12.5 kid size fits perfect for everyday use. He said it's comfy so that sounds great to me.
Under Armour,2024-02-11,Awesome shoe but does run small in size. My daughter wears a 5 and thank goodness I got her a 6 cause they are snug! Good ankle support and durable
Under Armour,2024-01-31,I bought these for my 9 yo for Basketball season. He loves them so much he wants to wear them to school every day. They are all leather and I know will hold up well! Hes says they are very comfortable and more supportive than his every day shoes. This picture is nearly daily use after 1 month!
Under Armour,2024-04-06,My daughter loves these basketball sneakers. She said they're very comfortable and easy move in when she's on the court. The colors are cool and stylish.
Under Armour,2024-04-01,very good
Under Armour,2024-01-06,They are comfy and the color is nice and bright. Exactly what I was looking for.
Under Armour,2024-02-21,"I bought these for my daughter for Christmas. She loved them, and said they are SUPER comfy for running, walking, and working out. Good choice of shoes!!!"
Under Armour,2023-09-24,Although I got them in a size too small I still wear them and they’re as comfy as can be. Really don’t see the green in them as much as I see it as grey but they’re still cute and comfortable.
Under Armour,2023-09-24,Excelente zapato
Under Armour,2023-10-21,Tienes que pedir medio número más de ti talla xq viene reducida
Under Armour,2023-10-22,"If you like this brand, I would recommend these shoes. They are comfortable and cute. The only issue I have is the toe box seems narrow, but I have only worn them twice. I will purchase more when I can get them for the same price or less than I paid for this pair."
Under Armour,2024-03-21,"I wore this sneakers all day and didn't feel a bit of discomfort,  was light arch support , great buy no regrets.  I went up a size to be sure and I'm glad I did"
Under Armour,2022-11-15,"They were a bit narrow, I would have liked more room for my pinky toe. They're just not as roomy as I'd like. They're pretty flat and not very cushy. But the arch is good. They'll do."
Under Armour,2024-04-08,"I've quite a few UA clothing that I wanted an athletic sneaker to match my joggers. This sneaker is comfortable, durable and fits great. I recommend this UA sneaker."
Under Armour,2024-04-09,Comfortable and have enough support.
Under Armour,2024-04-06,These shoes are amazing. I have worn themEveryday exclusively since spraining my2nd ankle in 9 months. Comfortable and supportive - I have stepped off the curb wrong but didn't sprain my ankle while wearing these!!!! Since they are all black I wear them even at work with dress pants.
Under Armour,2024-04-02,"I absolutely love the look of these! They’re really cute and even cuter when I wore them. I bought my normal shoe size, they’re a bit snug so I wish I would have went up a half size. I kept them and still find them comfortable. I did get a blister after the first time I wore them but haven’t since. If you tend to wear thicker socks with your tennis shoes I would definitely go up at least a half size. Other than the sizing I love them!"
Under Armour,2024-03-25,Very comfortable and they fit perfectly!
Under Armour,2024-04-14,"I wore these suckers for 5 days straight at Disney, with 2 of the days being around 25,000 steps. Not a single blister in sight and my feet were tired but not in pain. Highly recommend these for walking. For running they aren’t quite enough cushion for me, but walking is perfect!"
Under Armour,2024-03-18,These fit perfectly and are exactly as pictured. They are comfortable and fit well. I would definitely purchase again
Under Armour,2024-03-28,"Best fitting sneakers that I've had in a long time. Good cushioning on insole, and good arch support."
Under Armour,2024-02-05,"Fit well, has held up well also."
Under Armour,2024-03-23,Great shoes
Under Armour,2024-01-31,These shoes are great quality Under Armour shoes!! I had to change sizes for my daughter and had no problem getting the refund and buying a bigger size. The shoes are light weight and look exactly like the pictures.
Under Armour,2023-09-03,Great shoes sizing runs a bit small though!
Under Armour,2023-10-15,Fit percent and at a great price. Very durable and comfy
Under Armour,2023-09-22,"The shoes are as expected.  The sizing was correct and my son enjoys them.  As far as quality goes, the middle strip on the one tongue started to fray pretty badly after a couple of weeks but it's only a small strip."
Under Armour,2024-01-28,they  are good
Under Armour,2023-08-15,The shoe ran way too small . My child just out grew a size  6 with a bit of wiggle room left. I bought the next half size up. The 6 1/2 was smaller and tighter than the size 6  from the same shoe company.  If I bought a whole size up then the shoe would be to big. It ran small  in the toe area and side of the shoe. My son has a narrow foot but this was way to small
Under Armour,2024-02-29,"Exactly as I expected, the sneakers are awesome, very comfortable, I'm really happy with this purchase."
Under Armour,2024-02-16,well designed shoe
Under Armour,2024-04-02,"I don't think these are serious running shoes. I did try to use them that way, but they didn't seem to offer much in the way of stability. So overall, I think they're no better than four star. Because they're more running shoe in style than the real thing. Or maybe it's just preference. I prefer running shoes that have very little sole to them. In any case, I picked these up to use as comfortable work shoes. I work in a facility with a concrete floor and it's helpful to have a little cushioning. I""ve found that these do the job very well. And they weren't very expensive. For that purpose they're more than suitable and I recommend them."
Under Armour,2024-03-11,"I own a significant number of shoes of various styles, purposes, and brand names; however, this is my first pair of Under Armour shoes.  A few specific thoughts:- The fit is VERY accurate.  I wear a size 10½, but often have to order up a half size due to narrowly made shoes, but that is not the case with these.  The 10½ pair that I received fits perfectly in every regard.- These are extremely comfortable shoes.  It is not an exaggeration to say that these are the most comfortable running shoes that I have ever worn.- These shoes are as light as you would expect running shoes to be.  They are certainly lighter than the pair that they replaced and also lighter than the pair that I owned before those.Overall, these are great shoes and I highly recommend them!"
Under Armour,2024-03-25,"Purchased these for my dad and he loves them, he said they're are very comfortable to work in as a mover and fits him very well."
Under Armour,2024-02-27,"Great pair of shoes for running, walking or daily wear.These shoes are comfortable with a roomy toe box.  In a perfectly fit pair of shoes I wear size 10.5.  The ones I ordered are 10.5 and they fit... perfectly.  These shoes, unlike some, run true to size.  This is important when ordering online (i.e. you can't try them on).The insole is well cushioned and the main sole is absorbent to the shocks, stones, bouncing around you encounter while exercising.  The fabric of the shoe is several layers of firm but flexible mesh and is very breathable.  The tread has a semi aggressive pattern for varying surfaces.  The tread is very nice in that it has good grip, but is unlikely to pick up gravel or debris very easily.A quality pair of running shoes, well designed, comfortable, versatile."
Under Armour,2024-03-01,"I got these for my son to wear as a tennis shoe to school. He likes the colors and says they are very comfortable. They do not mark floors. If I could only keep him from getting them so dirty. I bought a 1/2 size up from what he needs so that he could grow into them some. He's only 12 and already wearing a size 10.5, he's going to be a giant. UA shoes have always fit him well as he needs a little bit wider of a foot/toe box. They strings tie well and do not come undone. These shoes would do well for any type of active lifestyle or activity. They seem like they will last him until he outgrows them."
Under Armour,2024-03-04,These are extremely comfortable and light weight. They look amazing and are easy to slip on and off.Looks-These look amazing and will go with almost any outfit.-They are a jet black which will help me keep them looking cleaner for a longer time-The sole goes up a little higher than my other sneakersComfort-I wear insoles on my shoes but tried these on without them and they are so comfortable.-The original insole is soft and the best part is that it doesn't peel off so easily-The shoelaces are thicker than normal shoelaces which make it so I can tie them tight and not have to worry about them digging into my foot-The heal of the shoe has a higher support which for me is super important since I will be using these for running.Con- They squeak when they get wet specially in the basketball court
Under Armour,2024-04-05,"My nine year old son loves these. He just got them yesterday, so I cannot speak for long term. But he liked them right out of the box. He says they are very comfortable to run and play in. I’ll update my review again in a month or so."
Under Armour,2024-03-18,Got as a gift for my grandson.
Under Armour,2024-04-10,Bought these for my son. He said they are very comfortable. I like the style of the shoe. These are his 2nd pair. I bought the white and black ones last year. Would buy again.
Under Armour,2024-03-28,They fit well & are durable for an active child
Under Armour,2024-03-25,"It's taken me over 2 different sizes to get my son shoes for school. He wears a size 6 in all the shoes ive bought him Target, Walmart or a shoe store. I even started with a 6.5 with Under Armour, he couldn't even put his foot in the shoes, went to a size 7 big kid. His toe was up against the tip of the shoe and still too tight. I will try an 8 big kid and see how this goes.  But these shoes run 2 to 3 sizes small."
Under Armour,2024-03-31,"So UA is pretty popular and historically their products are durable. We got these as part of the try before you buy since the last pair we bought ran small. These appear to run true to size but are not holding up in comparison to the competition.After 2 times being worn (albeit brief times), the shoe soles are already starting to break down and show wear.This style (or maybe I just got a bad batch?) just doesn’t stand up to their normal quality products."
Under Armour,2024-03-24,I wanted to love these shoes. The white on the sole was too big for my liking and it made them seem clunky. The rest of the shoe looked great. I wore them walking around for a few hours and my arches hurt. I have other shoes of this brand so it was definitely just this style.
Under Armour,2024-04-11,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 We love, love love these! I bought my daughter the iridescent pair! They're so beautiful! She said they are super comfortable and fit her feet true to the size! These feel very well made and like their going to be long lasting. I was trying to find her a durable pair! She plays so hard and runs through shoes very fast. I decided to give these a shot. They seem to fit very well and did I mention how dang cute these are 😍😍 lol highly recommend! Plus they were a very fair price, inexpensive."
Under Armour,2024-04-11,"My son absolutely loves his Under Armour Boys' Assert 10 shoes! They're comfortable, durable, and the alternate closure makes them easy for him to put on and take off by himself. With vibrant colors and a sleek design, they're not only stylish but also supportive for his active lifestyle. Without a doubt, these are the best shoes he's ever had"
Under Armour,2024-04-11,"These are perfect for my 4 year old! Comfy, easy to wash and last so much longer than others. We have had issues with the Velcro coming off in the past but these ones are still holding up great"
Under Armour,2024-03-08,My daughter says these are the most comfortable shoes she owns. Love that they come in wide.
Under Armour,2024-03-19,"I came across these shoes because I was looking for something with a wide fit for my child. Regular shoes do not fit him, and I wanted to find something comfortable for him but could not find many options with a wide fit. The wide fit did provide some additional room and made getting the shoes on easier, but the Velcro strap is hanging on to dear life as there is not enough Velcro to hold on to and the strap keeps falling off. I'll have to get some Velcro to add to his shoe to prevent this. Other than that, good fit and he says it's very comfortable."
Under Armour,2024-04-06,"These shoes held up amazingly well.  My daughter wears them daily for school, all day. There are no rips or tears. The tread is still good.  They have lasted all but the last 6 weeks of school because she outgrew them!  We are buying a new pair today!  Very satisfied!"
Under Armour,2024-03-22,My 8 year old loves to run and wears the tread out quickly. Bought these for him and they are lasting awhile and are very comfortable.
Under Armour,2024-03-01,"My daughter loves them, they are true to size and excellent quality"
Under Armour,2024-04-07,"I was replacing a pair of Sketchers sneakers I hated from the time I bought them. I visited multiple brand shoe stores in the Rehobeth Beach area, but couldn’t find any in extra wide width. I viewed multiple shoes and brands on Amazon’s site and took a chance on these. They arrived on a timely manner, actually earlier than promised. They are well made and top quality at a fair price. At first I was disappointed as they were too snug and considered returning them. I realized I needed to loosen the laces all the way down to allow a better fit and feel. Once I did that, and went on my daily 2 mile walk, the shoes broke in nicely and the fit is fine now. The collar around the ankle also appeared, at first, to be too bulky, but, with the daily wear, it too loosened, and I now have a comfortable and stylish sneaker. Mine are the gray with the synergy green highlights."
Under Armour,2024-01-10,"If you're on the lookout for a pair of sneakers that blend style, comfort, and performance seamlessly, look no further than the Under Armour Men's Charged Assert 10.

Under Armour,2023-07-19,"I recently purchased a pair of Under Armour running shoes and I am extremely impressed with their performance. These shoes have proven to be a game-changer in my running routine, offering exceptional comfort, support, and durability. First and foremost, the level of comfort these shoes provide is unmatched. The cushioning system incorporated in the midsole ensures a plush and responsive feel that absorbs impact effectively. It aids in minimizing fatigue, allowing me to push harder and longer during my runs. The padded collar and tongue also contribute to a snug fit and enhanced ankle support, preventing any discomfort or rubbing.

The combination of a solid outsole with excellent traction and a well-constructed upper provides exceptional stability. These shoes offer a secure fit, preventing any slips or movements that could lead to injury. My foot feels locked in place, enabling me to confidently tackle different terrains and maintain a consistent pace. Durability is another aspect that stood out to me. Despite intense use on various surfaces, the shoe's construction has remained intact and shows no signs of wear. The high-quality materials used in the upper, midsole, and outsole are undoubtedly built to last. This long-lasting reliability ensures that the shoes will serve me well for many miles to come. Moreover, the sleek design of the Under Armour running shoes is worth mentioning. Its aesthetic appeal is a bonus, as these shoes look stylish and modern while offering high functionality. The brand's attention to detail is evident in the thoughtful design, making these shoes suitable for both running and everyday wear. In conclusion, Under Armour running shoes have exceeded my expectations in terms of comfort, support, and durability. They provide a comfortable running experience, superb stability, and impressive longevity. Whether you're a seasoned runner or just starting out, I highly recommend giving Under Armour running shoes a try. They will undoubtedly enhance your running performance and keep you going mile after mile."
Under Armour,2024-03-25,Very nice. Light as a feather. Comfortable.  Recommended!!!
Under Armour,2024-04-12,"My teen son's favorite pair of shoes so far (and he killed MANY pairs). They are super comfy, good support, sturdy. So far he has worn them for 2 months and they still look and feel great! Ordered Wide - maybe that's why he's extra comfortable in them. Recommend!"
Under Armour,2024-04-02,"Great fit, great price, super comfortable"
Under Armour,2024-04-12,"The Under Armour Men's Charged Assert sneakers are an absolute game-changer! I've put these shoes through their paces, and they've exceeded my expectations on every front. Comfort? Check. Breathability? Double check. With their sleek design, they're not only functional but also look fantastic. Plus, the support they offer is top-notch, making them perfect for any activity, whether it's hitting the gym or running errands around town. Versatility is the name of the game here, folks. If you're in the market for a pair of sneakers that deliver in every department, look no further than the Charged Assert. Highly recommend!"
Under Armour,2024-03-15,"Bought these shoes for general use of working out and some running.  They fit great and have a very stable feel.  Sizing runs a tad small, if following the chart.  It said I was supposed to get a 10, but I got a 10.5 and they fit perfect.  Looking forward to using these in the gym!"
Under Armour,2023-12-11,"I’ve been in the market for new walking shoes for a while now and have tried on at least a dozen pairs before these. It was immediately apparent to me that these were the winning pair.Pros-Light weight but structurally strongThe heel cup is pronounced holding my foot in place nicely even when unlacedGreat shock absorptionMiddle of the road arch support, it neither pushes into my foot nor does it leave my arch floatingThe shoe widens out at the ball of the foot just right to support the sides of my feet without squeezing them.Cons-Basic insole, that’s comfortable but not as padded or advanced as other shoesLow rise ankle socks are a no no with these shoes as the heel cup I enjoy will suck your sock into the shoe and off your heel.All in all, for $40-$55 these are great shoes. They don’t even feel like you’re wearing shoes. The wife likes the look and feel so much she made me order her a woman’s pair of the same shoe. You can’t go wrong with this shoeUpdate 2/26/24 have worn these consistently and they look and feel new still. They handled a full week at Disney World averaging 25,000 steps per day at the parks. My feet were never tired or sore. No blisters chafing, or irritation from movement in the shoe because they are formed wonderfully around and behind the heel. I’m ordering a second pair for whenever these do wear out. My favorite pair of shoes in a long time. Genuinely enjoy these more than my brooks (which are still wonderful) and my ON cloud shoes which I feel are hyped much more than their actual quality and worth in my humble opinion"
Under Armour,2024-03-29,Fit as expected. Super comfortable. Durable. Stylish too! Will buy again!
Under Armour,2024-02-25,"Works great so far! Movable, comfortable, durable, good for running, jumping working, etc. Although if you don't get size wide than it's very long and thin and odd looking imo, I got regular 10.5 and then returned it to get 10.5 wide and it's much better and more normal looking."
Under Armour,2023-05-25,"I recently purchased a pair of tennis shoes for my active lifestyle, and I have been impressed with their overall performance and versatility.

Under Armour,2024-02-17,"After a lot of foot trauma of the last 53 years resulting in hallux rigidus, walking can be painful. What’s triggers it is a tight shoe with limited room for my toes. I ordered this shoe with a 4e extra wide, which provides a very large toe box. This shoe is light and is so much more comfortable than ALL my other shoes! I’m beyond excited to wear these moving forward. They seem like a quality shoe and the price was sub-$50, which is almost unheard of these days."
Under Armour,2024-04-07,Well made. Good fit and very comfortable
Under Armour,2024-03-05,Fits kind off loose and need to be tied snugg for more active activities. Very comfortable around and especially under the foot. Like walking on clouds. I would not use them for serious running but feels and looks great for active brisk walking.
Under Armour,2024-03-24,"Bought these because my Nike running shoes would squeak with every step and it was really annoying. After putting them on they felt REALLY GOOD, plus they have 4E wide which is amazing. After 8 months of use I haven’t once rolled my ankle (which is something I would do in my Nikes every 2-3 days) just bought the assert 10 recently and same exact quality as the last generation. Also got my mom and brother into buying a pair as well. 11/10 great shoe."
Under Armour,2022-08-04,"Uneven sole, thank you for making my foot hurt."
Under Armour,2022-09-23,"In one month shoes got torn. I never seen any other brand shoes ever get torn on top part of the shoes. Very disappointing with under armor brand.Usually, shoes get ripped off on front bottom part. In this case it torn on top part of shoes."
Under Armour,2023-05-21,"Hold on to your socks, folks, because these black Under Armor athletic shoes are about to knock your feet off!

It's a blissful experience that'll have you wondering why you haven't been wearing these shoes since birth.And the performance? Oh boy, get ready to unleash your inner sports superstar. With their advanced technology and built-in superpowers (okay, maybe not superpowers, but close enough), these shoes will have you jumping higher, running faster, and pivoting with the agility of a gazelle on roller skates.

Under Armour,2023-09-03,"Muy bien calzado, cómodo, flexible..."
Under Armour,2023-07-12,No long-term fatigue when wearing these great running shoes. You wont be disappointed!
Under Armour,2024-02-26,"Received as Xmas gift, fit was worse the more you wear.  I can no longer return and under armor will not assist with this product.  Price was great but fit and very hard rubber sole was awful"
Under Armour,2023-08-16,La talla y la calidad están bien pero me enviaron un color diferente al que pedí
Under Armour,2022-09-08,Lightweight and great support.  Perfect shoes and affordable!
Under Armour,2024-03-10,"At 6’6” and 225lbs, these are great shoes for everyday wear, beaters, or really anything you need them for. They are also a great price. One thing I notice, in being a bigger guy is the cushion and insoles wearing out really fast, especially being that I have a really high arch and wide foot.After two months, they still look and feel great, with showing just regular wear being I’ve worn them pretty much everyday, all day. Something else I’ve also been really impressed with is the outsole holding up nicely. Very little wear and tear, and has great traction.The feel of the shoe is on the firmer side, not necessarily hard, just a very comfortable and firm feel. It’s also really nice that they are wide. Regular width shoes just don’t work for me anymore.Haven’t worn Under Armour in 15+ years, and that was back in my baseball days. Definitely worth the price, and in my view, way better than shoes that typically cost $120+ that wear out very quickly."
Under Armour,2024-03-08,"These are great for wide feet. Fit well, comfortable, this is my 4th pair of these. They are a little lighter green than the in the photo but it’s no big deal, they look great"
Under Armour,2023-11-12,"Standard for all my reviews: When reviewing products, I always remain objective and honest about the product or service. I always review with information that I feel others would like to know about the product as I always assume what I'm writing will influence for or against the purchase. I always try to go above and beyond surface characteristics and input into quality, value and application. Most importantly, I will always end the review with an answer as to whether I'd purchase the product again which I believe is the most critical question pertaining to the item. To manufacturers: Want me to review your items, just let me know!I was looking to upgrade my shoe game because Nike has gotten so expensive recently. I really liked the simplicity of these UA shoes, good tread with a not-busy design. After receiving them I was immediately impressed with how light they are and how they feel overall. They would be a great walking shoe I think but I use Asics for that. The ONLY issue I have with these UA sneakers is that they are a little uncomfortable on the top of my foot near the tongue. I've tried loosening the laces a bit near the top and that helps but it's still a small issue. Other than that, I really like these shoes and I'm using them as my every day shoe when I'm not working out. They look great with shorts or jeans.I would actually purchase these again despite the minor discomfort issue. I'm hoping they just need to break in a bit more but it's not significant enough to keep me from purchasing them again, especially at the price point."
Under Armour,2024-03-20,Great feel and great look!  I needed the wide feet and this fit perfectly!
Under Armour,2024-04-10,"Bought these due to the price and thought why not. I tried these bad boys on as soon as they delivered and could not be happier. The inside of the shoe has a nice soft foam and they are light weight. Also, have a good look to them. Would definitely recommend."
Under Armour,2024-03-19,"I work 10 hours a day, 5 to 6 days a week and my feet get pretty sore since I’m on them for most of the day. Been wearing these for a week now and have really noticed a difference. And also they have good breath ability my feet don’t sweat."
Under Armour,2024-03-05,"How is this a running shoe when it has No ankle support, really low cut and instep hurts--It seems to be a common issue-- tongue too tight on top of foot, etc.I did casual brisk walking in my neighborhood for cardo.I bought this so that my Nike Air Max wouldn't depreciate as much, this was to be my daily wear shoeI don't have hilly high or uneven ground, yet my hip, ankles, knees seem to hurt as a result of wearing thisI won't climb 4 flights of stairs with thisOnly will use to walk at a regular place to and fro what's a short trip like to the nearby post office and back"
Under Armour,2024-03-29,These are light weight and help an amputee walking on prostheses to maintain their balance. As a prosthetic user certain shoes can throw off their gait when walking. Once a shoe is determined it will work well you don’t want to change the shoes. This style offers a variety of colors to be able to wear different ones without changing the way an amputees gait is compromised.
Under Armour,2024-04-04,Good looks and a wider toe box for great comfort and style.
Under Armour,2024-03-24,Size is accurate. They are comfortable. And make great basketball shoes.
Under Armour,2024-04-03,Great fit and feels like walking on air.
Under Armour,2024-02-29,"I love these. Comfortable, masculine and sexy looking shoes. Perfect for the gym or wherever. Good quality!"
Under Armour,2024-04-05,I bought these for my son and he is flat-footed and wears orthotics.  The sneaker gave him good support and was comfortable.  Very affordable as well.
Under Armour,2024-02-26,I had this pair originally and liked it so much that I ended up buying another pair after wearing my other ones out. I had the previous pair for a year or on a regular basis. They were very comfortable. Very durable and held up to all four seasons. I like them so much I ended up buying the exact same pair a year later
Under Armour,2024-04-12,No complaints. Perfect fit! Looks are awesome! Fits are right on! Size is perfect with room to spare.
Under Armour,2024-03-04,"Nothing to say, nice confortable pair of shoes, nice quality also as far as I can tell."
Under Armour,2024-03-06,I usually wear a 9.5 and they were too small so I went up to a 10 and they fit great. They are comfortable and light weight. I like the medium gray and they are easy to clean.
Under Armour,2024-03-16,Product fit as expected. I don’t know what other reviewers were talking about when they said they ran small.  Very comfortable to run and lift in at the gym.
Under Armour,2024-04-02,"This shoe is extremely lightweight and comfortable,this is my 2nd pair just a different color."
Under Armour,2024-03-10,"Well constructed, comfortable and small so I gave them to my son with a slightly smaller foot."
Under Armour,2024-04-03,"These shoes are lightweight, I was expecting a bit more breathable given the mesh fabric but that doesn't seem to be the case.Also there may be quality issues my left shoe fits tighter than the right one 😔"
Under Armour,2024-03-22,These are very comfortable. They came rather quick and I am pleased.I live near an UA outlet and I still can't find some particular shoes I previously had but Amazon never Fails me
Under Armour,2024-02-27,"I can't believe Under Armour would put their name on such a disgraceful product like the Men's Charged Surge 4 Running Shoe. Let me start by saying that I didn't even bother wearing them after inspecting the quality. The materials used in these shoes are cheap beyond belief. It's like they were made from the lowest grade of materials they could find.The soles are not even rubber as one would expect from a reputable brand like Under Armour. No, they're made of flimsy plastic that feels like it would disintegrate after a single run. It's absolutely shameful that a company with such a well-known name would attach it to something so subpar.Save yourself the embarrassment of wearing these shoes and the disappointment of wasting your money. Under Armour should be ashamed of themselves for putting out such a shoddy product. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for your running shoe needs."
Under Armour,2024-04-02,Love them
Under Armour,2024-02-29,"I'm typically a 6.5 in running/tennis shoes. Ordered in my normal size and the shoe fits a little more snug than I prefer, but not so snug they are unwearable. If I were to repurchase, I'd order a 1/2 size up. The color is exactly as expected and the shoe is light and has the right amount of cushion without being unsupportive."
Under Armour,2024-03-16,"I read several articles about the best shoes for dance aerobics and similar, and these and one other under armour shoe were listed in several recommendations.  When I saw how inexpensive they were (if you don't care which color, it seems at least one is always on sale), I thought there was no way they would be high quality, but then again, at that price it was low risk, so I ordered a pair in my usual size.  I found them to fit a little small, which I have never experienced with any of my other athletic shoes, but I felt like the fit was good otherwise so I returned and sized up half a size.I immediately liked them on first use (in an aerobics class, with dancing, jumping, etc. on a hard studio floor), and they are now my dedicated workout studio shoes.  I've worn them for several types of workouts and they are still outperforming and heir price point and holding up really nicely (holding up better than my altras that I run in which were three times the price).  They are supportive and have structure and still have some (but not too much) cushion.  I've not even swapped out the insert which I've done for other shoes. These are one of the cheapest pairs of athletic shoes I've ever owned and have definitely given me a positive opinion of UA."
Under Armour,2024-03-14,When I first got these they were giving STIFF and suffocation but now they feel so roomy and comfortable on my feet. I really like them for work and the gym. They stay looking so clean through the rain and all and they actually look cute on me.
Under Armour,2024-02-26,"I like this style for light indoor works outs and casual all day wear. I originally ordered my normal size of 7 1/2, but they were way too snug on my toes. I returned those and got a size 8. They are a bit wider than I prefer at that size, but still comfortable and snug."
Under Armour,2024-04-06,"I work retail and I am on my feet a lot! These shoes are amazing and comfortable. It feels like I’m barefoot. Awesome support. I’m a little over a year post operation from an Achilles repair, and my feet never hurt at the end of the day. They are more expensive but totally worth it. Can’t put a price on comfort"
Under Armour,2024-02-29,So the shoes are comfy as far as space. I dont have wide feet so the regular size fit perfect. I will say they are very uncomfortable to stand in. I wear them to school and don't even stand that long and my feet were HURTING! So these are not for standing for long periods of time and maybe its just me.
Under Armour,2024-03-11,"The shoes are incredibly comfortable, breathable and durable. The color is exactly as described and are true to size."
Under Armour,2024-03-30,"I will preface this by saying I have had these UA purple tennies a while ( almost a year)? & STILL LOVE them.  I do dance aerobics a lot &/ or walk at least 3-5 miles a day.  I wear size 7 and have neither a very wide, or narrow foo- just let nda normal.  The shoes, I feel, are well made, super comfy ( my 3rd pair of Under Armor... And the color purple are everything I had hoped for.  You can see me coming - that's for sure.I'm a fan... Get 'em.  ( And no sponsorship here). Btw"
Under Armour,2024-03-17,These are good shoes for my son. They are comfortable and affordable.
Under Armour,2024-04-03,"My 7 year old wears these shoes and they have held up well over the past few months! We've tried some other Amazon shoes that fell apart in a couple months, but I've been happy with the quality for the price and will plan to get these again in the future!"
Under Armour,2024-04-12,My son thought they are very comfy and loved the look
Under Armour,2024-04-15,Fit my daughter perfect. She says they’re comfortable. We appreciate the wide toe box compared to other brands. Would buy again
Under Armour,2024-04-11,"Stiff upon arrival but hoping they break in soon. Nice shoe, not too heavy. Son loves the black on black design. Would purchase again!"
Under Armour,2024-04-06,My son is very active and doesn’t take care of anything. A little cleaning and these look brand new. They can take a beating and will still be his go to shoe.
Under Armour,2024-04-11,Perfect fit every time.
Under Armour,2024-03-04,These shoes look good and also feel very comfortable. Great for a teen who’s always on the go and into sports.
Under Armour,2024-01-28,"Purchased the Under Armour Men's Yard Low Turf Baseball Cleat Shoe, and it's a game-changer. Here's a brief review:Exceptional Traction: 🌪️👟The traction on these cleats is outstanding. Whether sprinting on the bases or making quick lateral movements, I feel secure and stable. The strategic placement of the studs provides optimal grip on various surfaces, making them a must-have for the baseball diamond.Stylish Design: 🔥👟Under Armour nails it in the style department. The sleek design and attention to detail make these cleats look as good as they perform. They've become a conversation starter among teammates for all the right reasons.Overall Impression: 🌟⚾The Under Armour Men's Yard Low Turf Baseball Cleat Shoe is a home run. Whether you're a seasoned player or hitting the field for weekend games, these cleats deliver on performance, comfort, and style. They've become an essential part of my game-day gear.In summary, if you're seeking baseball cleats that excel in traction, comfort, and durability, look no further.

Under Armour,2024-03-29,very tight fit and has good grip
Under Armour,2024-04-01,They fit great and look great too
Under Armour,2024-03-13,"The most comfortable turf show I’ve worn, and I’ve worn a lot over the years. Hands down the best ones I’ve had. My teammates bought themselves these exact ones. High comfort level, durable."
Under Armour,2024-03-15,"This is my son’s second pair. Fantastic tread, great fit, and he loves the color way."
Under Armour,2024-02-14,My husband coaches our son’s baseball team and we play year around. He wanted a new set of coaches shoes as he called them. Reasonably priced since all sneakers are expensive these days. But they look good on and he wears them every practice and game so they must be comfy!
Under Armour,2024-02-14,"Excellent Fit. I have the same brand running shoes, therefore I felt confident that the sizing would be correct for my feet. It was.  I had a problem in the past making an assumption that the sizing for all the manufacturers would be the same. They aren’t. I learned that the hard way. Not much difference but enough to.be uncomfortable."
Under Armour,2023-11-02,"I bought these because we started playing in a new slow pitch softball league with a turf infield. They were more comfortable than I thought they'd be, and gave great grip on the turf, and surprisingly great grip while I played int he outfield which had regular grass. I even took them once to use to play golf and they were fantastic.Only downfall is that the inserts are glued in. So if you want to swap out your inserts, you have to tear them out. I decided to keep them in because they were glued, and I was pleasantly surprised at how good the shoes felt."
Under Armour,2024-02-19,"Price and the shoe looks great, very comfortable"
Under Armour,2024-03-12,"Very comfortable and responsive, high quality shoes. Love them so far!"
Under Armour,2023-12-23,True to fit and comfortable.
Under Armour,2024-03-23,"I recently went back to running. I trained and ran back to back races with these shoes and these are one of the most comfortable shoes i ever used. I feel like UA for me is hit or miss and this is definitely a hit. It’s light, it doesn’t feel like it’s messing with my strides, and bonus is it’s almost a built-in warning to drivers on the road (I bought the hot pink-ish one on a whim haha)."
Under Armour,2023-12-31,I bought these for my younger brother's birthday. He absolutely loves them! They're the first pair of shoes he's ever had where he tried on and they fit perfectly and they're very comfortable.
Under Armour,2023-11-20,"Comfortable, light"
Under Armour,2023-12-29,Muy bonitos y cómodos
Under Armour,2023-08-31,"Ive got plantar fasciitis, both left and right. These fit great and are true to size. I need shoes to be a little tighter, as I tend to get injured more with even a little extra room. Comfy so far. I do worry about the stitching long term, but time will tell."
Adidas,2024-01-08,"I've always been a fan of Adidas and the reason is they make comfortable quality shows at a great price. These are stylish, with god comfort, and a unique design.  I wasn't disappointed and they came in great condition and delivery was as expected. I can tell you how nice these shoes look and I've got my wardrobe in place already. What I like about these is that they're easy to slip on and off, they're, light weight, and they are a good fit. They have a nice hug around the ankle and they are true size so stick with my normal size and I have about 1/2"" cushion which gives me great comfort. You don't have to worry about the shoe coming off as it fits like a glove, so you can run, jump, or workout in these with no issues. The best thing about these shoes is the style, and then in a strong 2nd is the comfort. I own multiple pair of Adidas and these are just as comfortable as my older ones with a nice look. I don't have a call out for anything I didn't like I love Adidas and that's a fact."
Adidas,2024-03-24,Easy to put on. No laces to tie. Minimalistic simple design. Ordered the size 7.5 and it's true to size. Very comfy.
Adidas,2024-03-10,My original ultra boost got worn out for the years I had worn it. These fit true and is comfortable for a long period of time. As well as a great gym shoes
Adidas,2023-12-28,These are comfortable and great looking shoes.The slip on feature is nice and they feel tight on the foot once put on.I will advise to get at least a 1/2 size larger than a normal shoe. If the shoes are too tight in the toe you will see the outlines of your toes. It is not the best look!
Adidas,2023-12-10,"Very comfortable for everyday use, running, sports or gym use. They might have a tighter foot entrance than you're use to (if you haven't worn similar ones before) but not to worry, it's just tighter to make sure they stay on your feet. I have been buying this style of shoe from adidas for a few years now and I've been loving them. Very durable shoe as well. I've been using one of the pairs for 3 years as a work shoe (it's not one but I use it as one) and the shoe is in great condition considering it's a more labor intensive job and always on my feet. So I'd say these will last you a good amount of time and while having a good look and feel."
Adidas,2024-04-04,love the shoe very comfortable and extremely light weight
Adidas,2024-03-28,Wear these as my house shoes. Easy slip on. Very comfy. They are great.
Adidas,2024-03-28,My grandson loves them n says they are very comfortable
Adidas,2023-09-21,"After being in use of these for a couple months, these quickly became my favorite shoes in general above others! ADIDAS has always been my go-to shoes for just fashion and basic comfort, Forums in all forms are my personal favorite, and then I got these Grand Court 2s for long standing at work. All-in-all, I can best express my feelings to these as stylish, comfortable, and quite durable in the long run because they look great in basic all black and are the easiest to clean and shine after work. I often use these when I'm out shopping and visiting friends as well, I'm just that confident in these as comfort shoes and I have some decently wide feet as well. Since I have them in all black, the creases don't really show up when you are not actively looking for them, which is a plus and to add to that, it barely creases when casually walking. I was also told to size up by another half for better fitting, which I did, and I can still feel a bit of extra toe room as I slide my feet in.At the end of the day, it's definitely my favorite everyday shoes when I'm not over thinking about style and comfort. It's so good I would actually recommend this at base price, but I did catch these shoes at 30% lower so if it goes on sale, I wouldn't hesitate at the thought of buying these."
Adidas,2024-01-09,"I bought this court shoe for my husband to play pickleball on outdoor courts, and he likes it.  I would say it's true to size because he told my what size shoe he wears, I ordered that size, and he said it fits fine, no problems.  His feet are average width.  I call them his ""Run DMC"" shoes because it reminds me of the style of shoes Run DMC wore on MTV.  I can tell he loves the shoes because he is careful not to get them dirty and cleans them after every use.  He does not do that as much with his other athletic shoes.  He speculated that the shoes MAY have had some kind of slippery-type ""finish"" on the bottom of the shoes, because the first time he wore them, he slid on the court several times and actually fell, BUT the court may have had light/not visible moss on it from a prior rain.  He is very athletic so he didn't fall because he's old or out of shape.  Since that first time using the shoes about a month and a half ago, he hasn't slid or fallen since.  I knocked off a star for ""value for money"" because supposedly it was a deal at just under $63 but after that, about a month later, the price dropped to under $45.  I hate when that happens, ugh!  Anyway, I hope you found this review helpful because it's hard to buy shoes online since you can't try them on first."
Adidas,2024-04-14,I love my adidas Grand Court 2.0. I usually go with the Adidas Superstars but these are just as good withsome minor design differences. I did have to got up a a full size as they were a tighter fit than the Adidas Superstars. They are comfortable to wear and go with any outfit.
Adidas,2024-02-23,I tried the Air Force Ones but didn’t love the fit and they were difficult to walk in. These are a GREAT option for a similar look! Very comfortable to walk in and they fit perfectly to size.
Adidas,2023-08-02,"I love the look, the fit, and the comfort of Adidas shoes. These are attractive shoes, solid, white, with the three burgundy stripes. The only complaint that I have is that they arrived in a white bag with the shoebox inside. The shoebox was completely crushed and mangled. Not so much a problem for me, because it was going in the trash, but for some shoe collectors, the box is just as important as what’s inside."
Adidas,2024-04-07,Great product. I use them for work
Adidas,2024-04-02,Fit perfect great for anyone that wants a comfy cheap durable shoe
Adidas,2024-02-23,"Just what I expect from Adidas... A too quality shoe full of comfort and awesome looks. I have several pairs of Superstars and while I love them, especially for the old school look, these are definitely MUCH more comfortable. I mean, the in-sole is fantastic! Gel and crazy comfortable. I'll definitely be buying more"
Adidas,2024-02-29,"Just got these back after a year hiatus. Perfect shoes for basic, neutral stylin' around town. Pretty much will go well with anything your wearing. The soles are white and will last forever and don't scuff: they wear evenly well. I paid like $10 more at Shoe Carnival 3 years ago, so these are a steal and the price is still going down a week later. BUY these. They look good for at the beach, bar, work/office, airport.. I'm probably end up buying another pair for strictly inside around the house to keep the carpets clean, and one for nights on the town as these have been my everyday walking shoes. Downside is, the whitewalls of the soles of the shoes will show ANYTHING that get up there, so I'll wipe them with a Mr. Clean magic eraser once a week to keep them fresh looking (also, being former army, I know ""if you take care of your gear, your gear will take care of you"" 😋); also another reason I'm buying a pair for around the house, etc. Get them now, they are an investment and will last year's if you keep them clean. Will shrink slightly if you machine wash them. Air-dry with hairdryer or in the direst sun"
Adidas,2024-02-27,"I love these shoes. I thought I’d have to break these shoes in, but they fit perfectly and comfortably immediately. I typically wear a size 11, which is the size I purchased, and they were true to fit. These have a classic style that I can wear as everyday shoes. I’d absolutely buy another pair."
Adidas,2024-03-30,"They look nice and fit comfortably, perfect casual walking shoe."
Adidas,2024-03-03,"The insoles that come with these are barely thicker than construction paper, and offer zero support. Add your choice of quality insoles and you'll have a 5 star pair of shoes. This is the first time I have ever been disappointed in an Adidas product; I remedied the situation but wish I hadn't had to spend the extra money."
Adidas,2024-04-15,"I'm a teacher, so I'm on my feet a decent amount of the day and, so far, these shoes have been amazing. Incredibly comfortable with an almost molded soul, great tread, and stylish looking. I often get compliments from my colleagues and students (who can be very picky with what they like) on my shoes. These are my go to shoes for work or everyday now. Also a plus that it is a well known name like Adidas who has been making quality products for years and years now."
Adidas,2024-03-09,Fits true to size and don’t even have to break the shoe in. Great classic Adidas look. Completely satisfied with the shoes.
Adidas,2024-04-14,"I adore these shoes. For the price, they’re very comfortable and I love the way they look."
Adidas,2024-02-28,"I've been looking for something of a modern style mixed with a classic feel - this shoe is definitely it. It's comfortable, stylish, and i didn't break the bank buying a $100+ shoe. The shoe fits true to size in my experience and i have a wider foot. Would highly recommend!"
Adidas,2024-04-09,These were on sale so I thought to give them a try. Very light weight and comfortable. Had good ground contact and stability. Amazon recommended a half size larger which I did and they fit perfectly. I’m normally a 10.5 in men’s boots and shoes but 11 are just right. These have a really nice look and descent quality
Adidas,2024-03-03,"Love everything about these shoes.Best shoes I have ever owned.Lightweight, comfortable, functional and best of all a great price!"
Adidas,2024-03-19,"This was the first time I had bought this brand of golf shoes. They are very comfortable, and appear to be of very good quality. If I had a complaint, it would be that the soles retain too much dirt and are a little difficult to clean."
Adidas,2024-04-12,"I want to give these shoes a high rating but there is one downside to buying white, mesh shoes. In wet grass of a golf course, they will stain. I've not tried to wash them yet but I can easily see the sort of orange line about halfway up the front of the shoe caused by walking in tall grass (yes, I mean in the tall grass away from the fairway...where I frequently end up).Other than that, they are really good shoes. The gripping base holds the grass well even if it picks up and holds goose droppings and mowed grass.Very comfortable, good fit and very sturdy. I bought a size 14 and it's just right for my size 13 (or so) feet.I don't really pay  much attention to the staining as they're golf shoes and everyone's golf shoes show use.Good product."
Adidas,2024-03-18,"I haven’t yet had the chance to play a film round in them. However, for the price these are insanely comfortable and lightweight and the grip is phenomenal."
Adidas,2024-04-14,Very comfortable and looks great! Awesome price for the value!
Adidas,2024-04-11,"Feel great and have awesome grip on the course! I have a wider foot, and they fit just fine."
Adidas,2024-03-26,Fits true to size. Very comfortable shoe. Good value.
Adidas,2023-10-17,I love the style and fit of the shoe. Everything about them is great except that the insole of the shoe has worn down significantly in the heel and toes. All the way down to the fabric underneath. Other than that the shoes are great.
Adidas,2024-02-04,"Very comfortable. I normally order an 8 in sneakers, but it was unavailable in this color/style, so I opted to try the 7.5. It’s VERY wide around the heel, but the length is perfect. I’m returning them, but if the heel was more narrow, they’d definitely be keepers!!!"
Adidas,2023-01-29,"I love them,but they run too big. I usually wear an 8,but as I read in the reviews they run large I ordered a71/2,but they still big so I reordered a 7 and finally fit,so my advise is to get a number down"
Adidas,2024-03-23,"I’m absolutely in love with these sneakers !I’m wear them often and stay on top of keeping them clean & white.*Tip: Add a tiny bit of water slowly into a paste mixed with Dawn soap, baking soda, oxy clean and/or hydrogen peroxide. Brush on to clean, let air dry ir rinse and let air dry. Can also use a magic eraser on the soles but brushing works great"
Adidas,2023-08-21,"They are very nice, but they are not shoes to wear all day they have no arch support they are very stiff and the tongue doesn't stay flat you have to really pull and tug to be able to get them tied them. They are not for the ladies maybe for young kids . I bought them to replace an old adidas pair and they are not made the same anymore."
Adidas,2024-03-24,"Bought these for the color, style, and manufacturer. They're fine if you don't have to walk on rocks. The soles look thick but you can feel rocks thru the soles."
Adidas,2023-08-18,"Second pair because I love the first pair.  I need a wide toe box with thinner heal, and some arch support in a decent looking shoe.  These fit me so well.  Have tried 7 or 8 different styles this year and none of them fit me well or were cheaply made.  These shoes are very well made, good support with just the right outer sole thickness.  These are 9.5, I wear a 10 in other Adidas shoes.  I am an adidas fan but not impressed with this year's products, except these.  Size down a half size."
Adidas,2024-02-28,Ok so they are white ... I've prepared them with protectant and they are white sneakers. They seem to be true to size ... As they should be. They came on time ... Had to return a larger pair to then get a new pair but that went smoothly.Enjoy!  ~(*¿*)~
Adidas,2023-05-18,"Great shoe - not sure if I would label this a running shoe...maybe a walking shoe.  Casual.  I normally fit 10.5 and needed to get an 11, but worth the price."
Adidas,2023-03-11,A bit narrow but overall fantastic shoe.
Adidas,2023-06-24,"I got a pair of Adidas Nizza shoes for the same price that were very similar to these...at least it seemed. I just wanted a simple pair of white slip on shoes for sunny summer days. They are white, and slip on, but it gets pretty disappointing after that.The band on the side that is supposed to flex is more of a visual gimmick, which makes walking uncomfortable when it's combined with the shoe's unusual tight width.On the bright side- they'll stay clean for longer because I'll barely wear them. Realistically- I wish I had spent $10 more and gotten basic white shoes that I can wear without pain."
Adidas,2023-08-06,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Decently budget skate shoes which it was made for, elastic band pretty tight but in a skate sesh is manageable. Insole sucks. But the sole of shoe also grips to the board well which is what i want. Not made for walking shoes, get a pair of comfortable running shoes instead of these skate shoes."
Adidas,2024-04-15,I love the shoes. Great fit and great brand. So worth the money
Adidas,2023-08-02,"I have narrow feet and heels usually have problems with shoes coming loose at the heel and ankle area. I purchased these based on some of the reviews that stated that these shoes ran small/narrow. The problem is that the elastic appearing band at the arch of the shoe is actually not elastic and appears to be more of a cosmetic touch. Even with my narrow feet, I had problems getting my foot into the shoe without a fair amount of effort assisted by a shoe horn. The band is relatively rigid and places a great deal of constriction in the midfoot area and along the inner arch of the foot. Once my foot is in the shoe, this constriction is very obvious and yet the heel/ankle area remain loose. This is a very non-anatomically sized shoe. The length appears to be true to fit, its just this midfoot band that is extremely uncomfortable. Also, the sole of this shoe is very stiff. It is not at all flexible unlike what you would normally expect in a casual slip on shoe. I was very disappointed as I liked the cosmetics of the shoe. Unfortunately, I have to say that this is one of the most uncomfortable shoes that I have ever purchased. I should have heeded the negative reviews that talked about how uncomfortable these shoes are. I just thought that it was because people had purchased the wrong size shoe. However, it is the construction and design of the shoe that makes it ill-fitting and uncomfortable. Perhaps that is why they are discounted so much. I have owned several pair of Adidas shoes (in the past they tended to fit well as they tended to accommodate narrower feet like mine). However, this is the first Adidas shoe style that I could not wear (in the proper 8.5 size) due to extreme discomfort. Again, quit a disappointment as I thought that I could snag a “deal” as I really liked the sleek and clean look of the shoe. Will definitely be returning after just trying them on for 3-5 minutes."
Adidas,2023-04-30,These are comfortable but after a few months the insoles are deteriorating. It’s really weird. I’ve never seen a pair of shoes disintegrate like this.
Adidas,2024-03-29,Me gusto mucho por su comodidad
Adidas,2024-04-05,"I did like the comfort and protection for my feet, only draw back my shoe laces broke first time putting them on to tie the shoes. But replaced with white which all I had  but did work for the shoe. Less tired feet have noticed."
Adidas,2024-04-15,Fit was great and are holding together pretty good so farWas concerned about cloth but camp dry to be 100% every now and then and material is holding up better than expected
Adidas,2024-01-31,"They're great shoes, but I'm usually an 11.5 this shoe definitely runs small. Should have bought the size 12. Interesting has I have other Terrex products and fit fine as an 11.5."
Adidas,2023-12-13,"Adidas are the only brand I buy online because I know I won't have any fit problems. I wear a normal Size 10 and these fit as expected. They look cool and they are comfortable. Great traction and no issues so far. I will update this review should I have any issues when I put miles on these.Update 1: This is my second pair of Adidas Terrex shoes. My other pair are Terrex Skychaser LT GTXs. These AX4 are a little bit different. The toe box is a little bit more narrow. Not a problem for me, but keep this in mind if you have wide feet. Also, the sole and heel of the AX4 is much more firm. These are not squishy when you walk or run, but the sole is very supportive."
Adidas,2024-04-02,Great hiking shoe ! Has wonderful traction. Very comfortable and durable shoe
Adidas,2024-03-23,These shoes run small compared to other adidas. I’m typically a 9 men’s which translates to a 10 or 10.5 women’s and these fit super small my feet were hitting the front of the shoe. The shoe has a cool appearance but sadly don’t fit true to size.
Adidas,2024-04-13,Good for walking and running
Adidas,2024-03-17,This is a fair hiking shoe for the price I paid. It's a little snug but got more comfortable as I stretched them out. The black part of the heel has random white specks on them for some reason. For $59.00 it's a fair deal.
Adidas,2024-02-24,Love the ultra boosts. They hold up well. Super comfortable. Slide on and off and hug the feet. Use at the gym and for casual. Old pairs for hiking. Went with a little more color this time. Glad I did. I am typically between an 11.5 and 12. They fit true but the 12 is better for me. 11.5 definitely too snug.
Adidas,2024-03-11,"SOn loved them, comfortable, fast shipping."
Adidas,2024-02-27,would just like there to be a strap that makes them easier to put on like with the Yeezys.
Adidas,2023-11-12,"The shoes get more comfortable as you work them in, however they fit a bit tight around the toes."
Adidas,2023-11-20,"Perfect for running on dry roads.The shoe is a little narrow and squeezes a bit so it’s not the best for regular use.This is my second pair, they are well made and pretty durable if you are using them for it’s intended purpose. Ive used my first pair for 3 years and it’s still holding up.Great looking shoes and color way."
Adidas,2024-02-27,Extremely comfortable. Highly recommend.
Adidas,2024-04-01,Sneakers were already used and then terrible attempt to clean these garbage sneakers
Adidas,2024-02-25,Great shoes. My son wears them everyday
Adidas,2024-03-04,"I bought these because I am a huge fan of the old school Adidas. Not a fan of the new style logo !!! These were as close to old school as possible. Only thing that would have made them better would be the old school original logo on them.  Highly recommend these . Very comfortable, love the look ,fit and the price wasn't bad at all"
Adidas,2024-04-10,"Love, love, love these shoes!!  I was so surprised to feel how comfy these shoes are!  Very cute for that relaxed look!"
Adidas,2024-03-17,Love these shoes! Fit is good and they are super cute!
Adidas,2024-04-10,Love these sneakers
Adidas,2024-04-09,Took awhile to receive but perfect condition
Adidas,2024-03-12,Good fit
Adidas,2024-04-05,I bought these for myself. They are incredibly comfortable. They go with everything. My daughter ended up stealing them so I had to buy a second pair. They are an amazing value.
Adidas,2024-03-28,"Loved this look of these but I ended up returning because they weren’t the right size for me. I needed a wider, larger size. I think these were marked as men’s when I bought them, but they felt like a women’s size."
Adidas,2024-04-07,"These are definitely good running shoes that are very comfortable and well made o durable material. Also very reasonable on the value. I think they run a little small, but overall they are very good shoes."
Adidas,2024-04-10,These shoes look and feel great. Very light and comfortable. True to size.  Fit perfectly.  Will definitely buy these again.
Adidas,2024-03-08,"These are essentially a slip-on shoe, that tighten with the laces.  If you do not have a slim foot, getting yours into the shoe might not be very fun.  Luckily, there are large loops on the heel and what I would call the tongue.  These secure loops allow you to insert something that you can then pull up on.  For instance, I put a large screwdriver through one and a spoon handle in the other so I could pull up on the heel as well as the tongue to wrestle my foot into the shoe.  Once I finally got my foot into the shoe, it felt normal.  It did not feel too tight or uncomfortable.I have now worn the shoe for 72 hours straight as I can not remove it.  Just kidding, I was finally able to get it off with the help of my wife pulling on it like a tight boot.If you have ""chubby"" feet or just feet that are a little thicker than others, I would avoid this shoe at all costs.  Hope this helps you!Cheers!"
Adidas,2024-03-19,My son loves these.  They don't last super long - but that's to be expected; they're lightweight and mesh-like.  They take a beating pretty quickly.  But they look great and they're super comfortable.
Adidas,2024-03-04,"Do yourself a favor. If you have wide feet like I do, you’re going to love these trainers. They fit comfortably from day one. No painful breaking in. No tight ( or hot ) spots. As a bonus they look amazing."
Adidas,2024-03-19,Overall the shoes are great! Little tight on the tongue part only cause it’s not a tongue haha. Would buy again! Green ones look the best!
Adidas,2024-04-10,"I bought these exclusively for the gym based on another review.  They have a firm sole / feel that's good for weight-lifting stability, but they're also comfortable enough for the treadmill or biking.  I don't think I would try to run for any real distance in these though.....JMO."
Adidas,2024-03-19,"These are the brightest white, most stylish, most comfortable goes with every casual outfit shoe I’ve ever owned. Of course it was made by my fav brand. Absolutely love the logo design for the shoe. I will say this is absolutely a shoe that should be sprayed with waterproof spray multiple times before wearing."
Adidas,2023-11-08,"I went back and forth on these for a while before deciding to finally buy them. So glad I did! They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn! These shoes wear all day on the course and then to run some quick errands perfectly! No breaking in needed! I wish I had just bought them earlier! They don’t get dirty, they are super comfortable and look great with every outfit! Would highly recommend to anyone on the fence about them. Also, bought my true size and they fit perfect!"
Adidas,2024-01-15,"Love it, very comfortable walking around. Not to mention Cute!!! Pink is more peachy than picture."
Adidas,2023-10-15,Super comfy fit and very clean looking golf sneakers! Not heavy so you can wear them when you walk the course! Easy to clean waterproof! Works great on the course.
Adidas,2023-06-17,I just started golf and wanted a basic golf shoe. I think these are perfect for beginners! They are cute and comfortable. I will say I wish I would have sized down half. I am usually an 8.5 but they are a little loose in the toe and around the ankle.
Adidas,2024-03-05,This is such a good looking golf shoe. It also looks really good off the course.
Adidas,2023-10-07,Super comfy and perdition fit! Love that they can be worn off the course as well.
Adidas,2023-09-09,"Perfect fit, love these shoes"
Adidas,2023-08-16,Great shoes and comfortable! Even for walking the course these were great!
Adidas,2024-04-09,"Great casual adidas shoes. Very comfortable with good cushion and support. I got them on sale for $45 which is a great price for these shoes……frankly what they should have cost considering they’re normally $75! I’m a man and the 9 1/2 fit true to size. I read some reviews saying they were fake or sized wrong, didn’t have problems with the quality or size. Highly recommend."
Adidas,2024-04-09,"I typically wear New Balance cross-training style shoe. I wanted a pair of navy blue suede Converse one stars. I couldn’t find what I was looking for. I bought these and similar style New Balance suede shoes. The New Balance didn’t fit as well as these, so I returned them. These are very comfortable and they look great. Too bad they didn’t have a navy blue suede available."
Adidas,2024-03-28,"Great shoes, right size as described"
Adidas,2024-03-12,"These Adidas VL Court sneakers are satisfying to me. They have a nice, smooth, sleek, and minimalist profile that i admire. I don't like to be too showy with my shoes, and these fit that bill.  They are relatively comfortable also. Their minimalist profile make them easy to use for driving small cars with tight footwells. I wish the uppers were real leather, however, I don't mind them being synthetic since i will use them for everyday use. Now, I can only hope that the uppers don't separate from the soles due to adhesive deterioration as several shoes have done in the past. At this point, i would recommend these shoes to all."
Adidas,2024-04-10,"I love these shoes and haven't stopped wearing them since I got them! They did chafe the back of my foot the first day, but nothing a couple of band-aids couldn't handle. Other than that, they have been very comfortable, and they were also really easy to clean after I got caught in the rain. I should get them in other colors!"
Adidas,2024-04-10,"All that snickers with front tip wrapping up and top made of fabric so borring and annoing. Leather and flat soul , forever!!"
Adidas,2024-01-02,Very nice and fit perfectly
Adidas,2024-04-11,"Fits me perfectly, color and style look great and love how vivid the green is."
Adidas,2024-04-09,We love these shoes. This is my daughters second pair because she grew out of the 1st ones. They are perfect for her feet and true to size. She can walk around all day in these and she never takes them off.
Adidas,2024-02-14,These Adidas are well made. My 8 year old wears them to school a couple days a week between these and her crocs. They still look new and easy to clean.
Adidas,2024-04-06,"ADIDAS toddler sneakers often run small and narrow, but this sneaker fit perfect on my toddlers wide foot.  No more tears while trying to but sneakers on!  Will be buying other styles!"
Adidas,2024-03-23,"These shoes were such a disappointment!!! My son used these for school only and within a week one of the Adidas straps were peeling off. I ended up just cutting it off. I should have returned them, but my son became attached to them and wanted to keep them. I definitely would not buy them again or recommend anyone else to buy them."
Adidas,2024-03-22,My grandson likes them and they look good on his feet and he says they are comfortable
Adidas,2024-02-09,My daughter loves these shoes and says they’re very comfortable. My only complaint would be the laces will not stay ties. They are fairly thick and even a double knot tends to come loose.
Adidas,2024-03-15,This is the 5th pair of this style shoe that I believe I have bought for my almost 5 year old since she’s started walking. Love them
Adidas,2024-03-20,"These are nice except one shoe came with the Velcro not stitched to the shoe so it wouldn’t stay on. An easy fix if you having a sewing kit handy, but just seems really sloppy overall."
Adidas,2023-07-31,"I have been looking for months for a solid white golf shoe, and I finally found the perfect pair!  I normally can wear a size 7.5 in men's shoes, and a size 8.5 in women's shoes.  I purchased these in size 8, and they fit perfectly.  They are listed in men's golf shoes, but they are the exact same shoe as the Adidas Zoysia women's golf shoe, you just need to order a half size down from your normal women's shoe size."
Adidas,2023-08-15,I'm not one of these husbands that plays golf to get away from my wife.  There's no one I enjoy being with more than the lovely missus and I actually have been trying to get her to learn to play golf so we can go to the top courses of the world while we're traveling.  She was hesitant at first but she signed off on the plan when I told her that it would require a brand new wardrobe.Her first requirement was 'cute shoes' which I amended to 'cute shoes that will be decent to play golf in'.  She made it clear that she didn't want anything that looked like the golf shoes at the thrift store which I think are the only ones she's ever seen.  No problem with that here--these are great looking adidas shoes featuring the retro 1990's pale yellow color that has been making a strong comeback.  She hasn't actually started to wear them golfing yet but she loves the way they look and how they fit.  She's a big fan of adidas products in general so they've single handedly made her excited about learning to play golf.  Good job!
Adidas,2023-08-01,"The shoes are remarkably well-constructed with no flaws visible on both the upper or lower.  The sole offers the spikeless full-grip pattern, and plenty of diamond-shape mini treads to hold you and your game securely to the ground.This shoe design has mesh over the toe box and near the end of the foot, and is not waterproof, but all other areas of the shoe appear to be waterproof, and easy to clean at the end of a round.  Overall, definitely the quality level one would expect from Adidas.Shipment arrived in a bag, never a good look for me when receiving a pair of pricey shoes where I might want to use the shoe box for storage.  Upon opening, the shoe box was completely smashed, so no storage box.  The shoes were well-protected and in great shape.  This item does not fall into the ""fast replacement"" category, only return and rebuy."
Adidas,2023-12-03,Toobig
Adidas,2023-09-03,I thought I was getting a white golf shoe with a touch of orange. There is way too much gold details for me. Other than the color these shoes are very comfortable. So I’m going to order the pure white version
Adidas,2023-08-25,Its a nice pair of shoes and they are true to size! Ho for it!
Adidas,2023-08-18,"So, the shoe itself looks really nice. It feels cushioned and comfy, and it seems like it would be a really great golf/walking/whatever shoe. Unfortunately I ended up with a UK 6.5 instead of a US 6.5 so they are too big, which is a bummer, because they’re very cute I a great color combo!"
Adidas,2023-08-15,"I have the pink version of these shoes and the shade of color is lighter than in the product photos. Quality and craftsmanship look great, but I ordered a 6 and received a 7 1/2. Also, different colors are more affordable than the pink version."
Adidas,2024-04-01,"My husband is pretty picky about sneakers and I wanted him to have some that are neutral to wear with multiple things and he really likes these! We didn’t get them for working out necessarily, just for when we do lots of walking while traveling. He wore them for the first time on our week long trip last month and we walked about 10k steps a day and he said they were extremely comfortable all week long!"
Adidas,2024-02-24,"This shoe feel great and is very stylish, the only CON not as much traction on the sole."
Adidas,2024-02-23,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Son muy cómodos y los uso para entrenar en la caminadora y no me sudan los pies. Ya compré los blancos también para variar el color."
Adidas,2024-02-08,"I prefer to purchase Adidas running shoes in part because they almost always fit me perfectly. These are no different. The fit is perfect and that makes them very comfortable when I run. Thus far, my only issue with the shoes are the tongues.  I need to adjust them before I tie my shoes. They will get bunched up if I don't do that. That is my only issue with the shoes."
Adidas,2024-02-07,these Adidas shoes are amazing. Feel comfortable A+ plus seller will continue to buy.
Adidas,2024-01-14,"My husband loves these shoes for walking. True to size, very comfortable and great price."
Adidas,2024-01-12,What can you say it’s an Adidas quality shoe all the way around
Adidas,2023-11-30,Perfect
Adidas,2024-04-16,Like walking on air!  Great value and look good.
Adidas,2024-03-20,"Supportive, good shoes. A little awkward to put on at first, but fit like a glove."
Adidas,2024-04-06,This is my third pair. Great for running and for casual wear.I usually wear 12 but 12.5 is better for me in this style.
Adidas,2024-02-29,"Bought for my 12 year old son who is disabled so he can't tie shoes was hoping these would be better but there very hard to get on because the ankle area is a Lil small, but besides that great shoes for the price"
Adidas,2024-04-11,"Fits true to size, its comfy, pretty basic shoe"
Adidas,2024-02-16,"Thanks to Travel and Leisure online magazine for recommending an Adidas running shoe - I couldn't find the specific one recommended and instead chose this Men's Lite Racer Adapt 5.0 Running Shoe: it did not disappoint! These are by far some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned: they are slip-ons, make excellent walking shoes, and are almost perfect for a treadmill run (""almost"" because they somewhat feel like slipping off but never actually do). In the many miles of walking or running on them, I have yet to have swollen feet (a little expected soreness maybe, but never swollen) and I almost do not notice having the shoes on. They are also very breathable. Finally, for the price I paid, they go from excellent to an outstanding value!"
Adidas,2024-03-02,"Excellent sneaker for the price. Easy slip on , no tie. Also comes in wide. Have wide feet abd Nike sneakers I always return. They seem to be be made for a 2 inch wide foot. Buying again. My go to sneakers from Adidas"
Adidas,2024-04-13,"These shoes are light and very comfortable in my opinion. Just slip them on and you’re in business. I wear them for everyday walks, hikes, and even at work."
Adidas,2024-04-13,"Overall, quite happy with these shoes. They are comfy, light and quite stable! Which is not the case with some of the recent Adidas running shoes - they have flip up outsole in heel area on the outside.These shoes are very good, was able to even hike in them on a muddy trail!  The only dis-advantage is that the material in the heel area started to peel off on  the inside post 1 year of wear."
Adidas,2024-04-05,"The quality is very good, light weight, and has good air flow. It has very good air flow that water will soak right thru. Not recommended to wear in rainy day."
Adidas,2024-02-29,They fit good and are comfortable.
Adidas,2024-03-22,Nothing to dislike. A wear a 11 & a half shoe size. Very comfortable and good looking shoes. Great value from a trusted shoe brand.
Adidas,2024-03-30,I bought 2 pair of shoes at the same time and find myself wearing these more.  I have a new everyday shoe with these.  Incredibly comfortable!
Adidas,2024-03-10,These fit my wide foot perfect. Very good walking shoe. Feet stay cool all day.
Adidas,2024-03-25,I really like these shoes. I'm a very active 287 lb man and cover a lot territory every day. These shoes have held up well and my feet dont hurt at the end of the day.
Adidas,2024-03-05,"So normally I don't post a review of shoes until they have to be replaced, that way I can comment on the longevity and such. But these shoes have inspired me, so to speak.I have been wearing them for a couple weeks, and they were very comfortable right off the bat, nice fit, good support, and all that. I wear my sneakers around work, as well as on my 2 mile walk on lunch break. So far, so good.But! Today I finally took my walk on wet ground and I am very disappointed with these shoes.It should be noted that:1. It was NOT raining although there was an on and off mist.2. I did NOT step in any puddles, or visible standing water, just wet ground.Still, I did not even get halfway through my two mile walk before my socks were noticeably WET. Just from whatever water my steps were throwing. No puddles, no nothing. My pant legs right above the shoes were barely affected. At the end of the entire walk, I can feel water squishing in my shoes.I don't know if it's because of the mesh material on top letting the water in, or what. What I do know is that the shoes I just got rid of, that had visible holes in the canvas after 2 years of daily wear, did not get my socks this wet.If you are planning to wear these shoes around the house, or work, or to the gym, they could be very comfortable, which is why the 3 stars. Maybe I am misusing these shoes for their original intent, but I kind of feel like ""shoes"" should be able to be worn ""outside"" at a minimum."

 This is the second pair of these Adidas that I have owned because I love the first pair so much and they were out after about a year. These are very affordable comfortable and go with everything."
Adidas,2023-09-10,Me encanto muy bonitos y cómodos
Adidas,2023-07-10,"I like the style, I love how lightweight they are but they rub my heals bad!"
Adidas,2023-07-23,"I have constant foot pain. Adidas and Skechers seem to be the only shoes that have very cushioned insoles that make the pain bearable. I specifically searched for Adidas with cloud foam insoles and these shoes Adidas Women Lite Racer 3.0 came up in the search. I loved the way these looked and was happy to see they were made out of recycled materials so I purchased them. Unfortunately, when I went to lace them I could tell immediately that the insoles were NOT cushioned. In fact they were EXTREMELY hard. I was heartbroken as I had thought I found the perfect shoes for work. Worst part is I got sick and missed the return window so now I am stuck with these brand new shoes that I cannot wear. I love an support that Adidas are looking into sustainable products but wish they had kept the cloud foam insoles. I've searched for other Adidas with cloud foam and have not had much luck finding ones I like and can wear to work. It seems to me they are veering away from cloud foam insoles. Very disappointing."
Adidas,2023-07-30,They were great for the price
Adidas,2023-10-18,"My daughter loves these shoes but this is the second time I have bought them and the foot bed insert cracks within the first 3 days of wearing them. The inserts say ""recycled material"" so I'm not sure if this is the issue or what."
Adidas,2022-10-08,"Item was delivered within reasonable time, kind of cute if you squint really hard. However, it looks really fake. This was not made in china it was made in someone’s backyard using a 3D printer. My apologies to the vendor but not cool. The box was all damaged, an elastic band was used to keep the box from opening. Disappointing."
Adidas,2024-01-02,Seems very bad quality. No heel comfort.
Adidas,2024-04-07,"I would say they are as cute as can be, and extremely comfortable , true to size . Great for walking."
Adidas,2024-03-28,"I also bought a pair of Reebok walking sneakers, but there's absolutely no comparison to my new Adidas! They looked & felt very bulky and heavy. And hot. These are simply a pleasure to wear! At home I always have my comfy slippers on. After I tried on Adidas Runfalcon 3, I wore them around the house awhile, and much later realized I still had them on. Sooooo comfortable, like a lite, very comfy cloud. They could be just a tad smaller, but I have RA, so it's much better than tight. It's actually perfect for me. Comfortable, lite weight, good support and looks good! Love them! :)"
Adidas,2024-02-14,I literally love these sneakers.  So comfy for walks and working out.  Super cute and the price is amazing.  I wear these all the time and will probably purchase again.
Adidas,2024-04-11,"I bought a pair for my daughter, she normally wears a size 8 for her other running shoes (Brooks), the 8's were too big so I had to exchange them for a 7.5, she doesn't own any shoes smaller than an 8.  But, the size 7.5 was a great fit with this shoe. She said they were super comfortable, and they looked great on her feet!"
Adidas,2024-03-07,"Color looks SO cute, and so light weight so they are comfortable to wear for long days!"
Adidas,2024-02-06,Good value for money. Nice and confortable.
Adidas,2023-12-30,This s the best sneaker I have ever had!  The wide heel gives me the stability for walking.  I generally walk a couple of miles daily and on city streets.  The size 6 is a perfect fit.  Very comfortable.  I wish I had found this sneaker a long time ago.  Thank you Adidas
Adidas,2024-03-13,"Opened the box, and the first thing I see is the this security  tab left on the  shoes.  How in the world did someone forget  to take that off? Thankfully  it was easy to cut of with bolt cutters. But honest what if someone didn't have bolt cutter?  Unfortunately  I'm not impressed.. it's not professional. Shoes are comfortable  and I'm perfect condition  very pleased."
Adidas,2024-03-01,"I like these a lot. Well rounded and hug your feet like a glove, but for your feet though!The way they look and feel are both amazing. Always been an adidas fan and for the price definitely worth every penny. The quality is there although I’ve only wore them for about a month and have yet to play basketball or run around in them.Overall a great purchase!"
Adidas,2023-10-03,"I Like everything about these Slick looking shoes!! I know the colors are wild, but I'm bored to tears with black and white, blue and white, and oh look Red and white athletic shoes! Well designed, comfortable, light  ,stop on a dime bb shoes for me! Very impressed!"
Adidas,2023-04-27,"Overall good shoe.Pros:Very good traction,lockdown,lateral support , stability,and ok Cushion.Durable enough to play outdoors on occasion but I wouldn't recommend as your primary outdoor shoes.Bounce Cushion is decent especially in the heel .Cons: Although cushion is decent playing indoors it just wasn't enough cushion for me. Since I have knee issues.It's a little heavy compared to most modern day BBall shoes. If you are using something like the Curry 9 or JA1 then switch to these you will definitely notice the weight difference.Ventilation is poor and gets very warm .Overall good shoe,I think if you are a shifty guard like Trae Young or a younger player, or have healthy knees and ankles these will be worth trying."
Adidas,2024-01-23,They are very good and beautiful.
Adidas,2024-03-22,Fit more comfortable than other Adidas.
Adidas,2024-04-01,We got these for my daughter for basketball and they look awesome! I want to wear them. They fit well and have really good traction.
Adidas,2024-02-21,"I’ve been looking for a new pair of Adidas because my normal pair was discontinued. I really like these as gym shoes and for lifting. Wouldn’t recommend for running, not enough cushioning."
Adidas,2023-10-22,Great style and comfort. Buy it.
Adidas,2024-02-01,"Got these for my 8yr old, he loves them! Good looking shoe & he says they're super comfortable, too!"
Adidas,2024-02-04,Comfortable and good quality. My son loves them!
Adidas,2023-08-28,Great fit and comfortable for my son. Holding up well.
Adidas,2024-04-06,My kid loves them
Adidas,2024-03-24,Comfortable true to size
Adidas,2024-02-16,Great grip for kids learning about golf
Adidas,2024-01-31,Grandson loves them!
Adidas,2023-08-10,Just what we needed
Adidas,2024-04-13,"I bought these for my daughter to have for golf season, and they were great! The quality was great for the price, they are comfortable, and they are very cute! They are good for golf or just to where anywhere. They really held up during her season, and helped keep her feet comfortable when walking in long tournaments."
Adidas,2024-04-08,I have wide feet and these fit perfectly. Comfortable and great price.
Adidas,2024-02-19,"Comfortable, true to size chart. Color just as in picture."
Adidas,2024-02-18,"I’ve been scouring trying to find the perfect sneakers, these feel and look great. They do hug the inside of your ankle, but lace placement and just wearing them out can help fix that. They offer arch support and the fact that they’re made out of rubber and not foam is a huge plus in my book. They also have a protective barrier around the toes and sides of the feet to keep the net from tearing. I got the purple and gray ones and they’re really cute."
Adidas,2024-04-10,Nice fitting - good style. Would buy again!
Adidas,2024-04-06,"After doing research on an affordable golf shoe for a beginner, I found the best price here on Amazon.  Very comfortable shoe without spikes.  Look like regular sneakers.  Very happy with them!"
Adidas,2024-03-18,"Good fit, durable and light"
Adidas,2024-02-26,"These shoes looked nice, fit well, and were comfortable, but I wore these all last summer, and if the course was at all wet, so were my socks and feet. Something about these shoes pulls the moisture up into the shoe."
Adidas,2024-03-18,I wear a size 8 shoe and found that these are true to size. I was worried that they would be flat or uncomfortable but not at all! I wore them to the gym (60min) and then went grocery shopping with them and my feet did not hurt once. I am currently wearing them at work. I love how I feel some compression around the curve of my foot and the top strap makes them feel secure as well. I also love how they are slip on AND stylish!!I bought the black ones with the white and pink sole. Buy them! :)
Adidas,2024-03-27,"These are so comfortable and slips right on. I use it every day for work, as I do a lot of walking. My feet don’t ache and the cushioning inside is wonderful. Love that I don’t have to stop what I’m doing to re-tie my shoelaces. They’re also easy to clean."
Adidas,2024-03-27,"Fits true to size, comfortable, stylish, wore them for the first time for a trip I took that had tons of walking and I never blistered. Would absolutely buy another pair."
Adidas,2024-01-04,"I was looking for a slip-on shoe to replace my Skechers GoWalk shoes. I like to go for quick walks through my neighborhood and like the slip-on vs. laced running shoes.These were affordable and thought it would be a step up in brand name. Sorry Skechers! I own a pair of women's 9 Adidas Court shoes that could've sized down with. Based on that and the other reviews for the Puremotion Adapt on sizing down, I ordered a women's 8.5. Holy tight and narrow! I would consider my feet to be normal width. The 8.5's were extremely hard to get on and the shoe felt narrow. Thankfully with free returns, I swapped them out for a size 9. Still a struggle to get on but more room in the toe box & still a bit narrow. I'm hoping with wear, this all will improve. Out of the box, no rubbing or blisters. This is a huge plus compared to all of the Skechers GoWalk shoes I've purchased in the past (definite blisters from the breaking-in period).As for support and cushion - I disagree with other reviewers. Yes, there is some memory foam in the sole. But not a lot and very little arch or heel support. I can't imagine using these shoes for running. I like the looks of them. I wear them without socks. If you wish to wear socks, I would size up!Affordable, stylish but tight and could use more arch support and cushioning!"
Adidas,2024-03-27,"These shoes are cute and very comfortable, great work shoes."
Adidas,2023-09-25,"This is my second pair. I bought my first pair a year and a half ago at Nordstrom Rack and they are so comfortable. I wear them to work and I stand/walk 8 hours on concrete. I switch these out with another pair of Adidas to change up my look and they held up for a year and a half. I got these because my last pair were looking a little gnarly. Still wear the old pair for long walks. Aside from work I generally walk between 3 — 6 miles almost daily just to give you an idea how much wear these get.Also, I should note I have Morton’s Neuroma which is a sharp pain with nerve damage between the 3rd and 4th toe from wearing narrow toed high heels for most of my adult life. If I don’t have the right shoe I cannot run, walk, or stand for long periods of time without pain.Besides being comfortable they’re a good looking shoe. I get complimented on them a lot.I’m between an 8 to 8.5 in shoe size, but because I have a wider foot and walk long distances for exercise, and get around 14,000 steps just at work my feet tend to swell so I purchased size 9 in store after trying size 8.5.They are a little big in the toe box, but not sloppy big. I needed the extra wiggle room due to swelling from being on my feet all day. The 8.5 would’ve been fine for casual wear. Also, they are designed to be worn with or without socks. I wear these without 100% of the time. I just spray my feet with dove deodorant and slip these puppies on and I’m good to go."
Adidas,2024-02-22,"It took me almost 10 minutes to get my feet into these shoes, the first time I tried them on. And now it takes like a couple of minutes. Wearing any kind of shoes should not take more than 30 seconds in my opinion. The problem is with the flexible back heal which turns inwards while you're getting into them. Once on, very comfortable!"
Adidas,2024-03-27,"Finding sneakers that are both stylish and comfortable is not a simple feat. Take advantage of these Adidas without any regrets. Not only does the cloudfoam provide comfort and arch support but the inclined design (admittedly surprising initially) of this specific style is a game changer! No back pain, no knee pain, no foot pain, just all day support and relief that it was money well spent!"
Adidas,2024-03-13,"Bought them because previously been using NMD R1.I like this due to a good quality(no issues with fabric, thread), nice comfort, they feels a little bit loose at the heel, but i think it is ok. They are really light and i link the idea that “boost” material is grinded so it will be more easier to remove dirt."
Adidas,2024-03-17,Very comfortable and beautiful
Adidas,2024-03-22,"Good quality, support and very light."
Adidas,2024-01-05,Only problem I had was they are tight to get on.
Adidas,2024-04-04,I thought this was not original but they are. It feels a really confort shoe and good materials. I love this shoe and I will see how the are for running specially.
Adidas,2024-02-16,"Walking all day on concrete in a warehouse style setting, these guys feel amazing. Super light and such cushion it feels like, yep, clouds.They fit like a glove on your feet. (May feel like a tight fit it you’ve never had an ultraboost style shoe from adidas.)If you’re a runner or someone whom is on their feet all day, this style shoe is the move."
Adidas,2023-12-04,"I bought these for my son.  While they may be comfortable on him, the quality of the shoe is horrible.  The soles are “painted” black versus how they used to be made with black silicone/plastic.  The paint has begun to chip off and the sneakers look old even though I only bought them 2 months ago.  Don’t waste your money on this sneaker."
Adidas,2024-02-26,"I now have 3 pair of these, they are super comfy and give great support.  I have bad feet and constantly fighting plantar fasciitis.  These are well made shoes and my new fave!"
Adidas,2024-03-30,Hard to find size 15 golf shoes and the price was excellent. Shoes are very comfortable and perfect for my grandson.
Adidas,2024-03-27,Great price. Adidas shoes last longer and are comfortable.
Adidas,2024-04-06,"Im a size thirteen with a bit wider foot, and these are super roomy.  So much that I would say I probably needed a 12.5.  The end result is there is a clicking when I walk.  This is because the material is like a coated cloth, it isnt mesh and it isnt leather.  Definitely a stiffer water resistant material.  When it flexes it makes crinkle or click sound.  And I have so much room it can flex a lot.I wanted the boa fastener to ease my back when tying shoes, plus I dont want my shoes to come untied during a round.  With that said, it is difficult to pull these laces tight at the toe.  You can get it tight at the top by the ankle, not as much down lower.  Also, the boa still works loose over the round.  It doesnt come undone, but it does loosen up.These are comfortable on the soles of your feet, however typical with adidas that will flatten out quickly.  I think these shoes would be ok for rounds with a cart.  I dont think they would be great for walking rounds.  The spikeless soles work great and allow for excellent leverage without digging up the greens or tee boxes."
Adidas,2024-03-23,"Very comfortable shoes.  They run a bit wide, which I personally love. Was skeptical of the boa design at first, but have come to appreciate it now that I'm used to it. No more having to worry about them coming untied.  They are perfect for wet weather play. Very first time I wore them was after a lot of rain had fallen and my feet stayed completely dry."
Adidas,2024-02-22,"In my experience I cannot beat these for comfort, fit and waterproofness.  I've had the very expensive golf shoes with 2 yr waterproof warranties to the price value shoes.  At one time I even tried Goretex hiking shoes to comfort and waterproofness.  Bu these have been the best, especially for the price.I just bought two more pairs after two and a half years with another pair.  I play twice a week and always walk year round."
Adidas,2024-02-21,"I had a different color of these exact shoes for a year, they were awesome, but using them everyday eventually they gave in to the stress of wearing feet lol.. It was time to get a new pair. These are direct replacements of a different color. Everything I expected!"
Adidas,2023-12-17,"My second pair in a different home. I found these shoes at a pro shop at a really nice golf course and couldn’t believe they were under $100 so had to try them. They are an odd material but so light, so comfortable and so waterproof. I am a devout BOA user so finding BOA laces on an Adidas shoe for $75 is crazy - love them!"
Adidas,2024-02-10,The shoe fits comfortably and the shoe tie harness does a good job.
Adidas,2024-02-15,Our daughter plays basketball and these have been great. Solid support for her ankles and great on the court. Great purchase for the price.
Adidas,2024-02-07,"Shoes look great BUT my son complains they hurt his feet every time he wears them. Maybe it's just him, IDK, but an honest review."
Adidas,2024-02-19,Excelente!
Adidas,2023-12-15,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Great quality! I ordered a size 5 for my 10 y/o daughter. Fit as expected. Comfortable and cute. Way cuter than expected. My daughter is so pumped to wear these for her very 1st tournament tomorrow. Worth every penny!"
Adidas,2024-03-27,"First, I don’t wrestle. I got these for martial arts. Second, I’m a female so I was nervous about the correct sizing etc. I measured my feet (and surprise it my typical everyday shoe size) and picked both my exact size it landed on and the very next half size up since that’s what I do for hiking and running shoes and ordered both to try on. I tried them on with and without socks. They fit perfectly. MAYBE the exact size is a hair snug along my pinky toe but I couldn’t see that being a big issue as the material will like relax a bit with wear. I’m going to wear both on the mat today and next week and see if I can even tell a difference in comfort. At home I was able to perform my routines etc comfortably in both. Cannot speak to longevity yet of course but I am not seeing anything “cheap” or with obvious weak points yet. I will say if you have truly wide feet then I’d look for your size in wide. Hope this helps since I’m always nervous buying shoes without trying them on first."
Adidas,2024-01-08,"My 11 year old (yes a big kid) has no issues with these wrestling shoes. They are in great condition still and its almost finished this season. I am sure he will wear them as ""normal"" shoes after, he is growing and will need a different size next season and these are comfortable."
Adidas,2024-02-03,My son went thru 3 pairs before he found this pair and he said they were comfortable but most importantly….they stayed together. His other ones fell apart. They look great as well. He said he would recommend these
Adidas,2023-11-09,"I recently bought these Adidas men's wrestling shoes for my son, and we're extremely impressed! The shoes offer excellent grip and support, allowing my son to move confidently on the mat. The quality is outstanding, and they fit true to size. Plus, the stylish design is a bonus. These shoes have definitely enhanced my son's performance and confidence during matches. Highly recommend for any young wrestler!"
Adidas,2024-02-12,Very comfortable shoes. fit my legs well. I payd for fast delivery and they arrived really fast
Adidas,2024-03-01,My daughter does boxing for sport and she loves ❤️ this pair Adidas wrestling shoes she says are really light and really comfortable
Adidas,2024-02-17,My son loved the pink.  True to size.
Adidas,2024-02-20,Bought for my husband and they are perfect. He’s an adidas guy and very particular about his sneakers.These are super nice!!! You won’t be disappointed.
Adidas,2024-02-26,Todo según lo publicado!
Adidas,2024-03-24,"First off, I want to start off with the positives. The shoe itself looks amazing and very sporty. The gray and silver colors offset by the neon orange sole and interior looks fantastic. As far as comfort goes, the generous sole thickness makes for pleasant walking, hiking, and even gym-use. My only complaint about the shoe is that the insoles themselves are lackluster and extremely disappointing. After having the shoe for simply two weeks and after doing some extensive walking, I noticed that the insoles were slowly running up the back of my feet due to slippage. In an attempt to be creative, I replaced the insoles with the same insoles I was using in the New Balance shoes these were intended to replace. I may have created a Frankenstein shoe in the process, but no one will know or be able to see the insole replacements. The end result is a fantastic shoe with an extremely comfortable insole that no longer moves."
Adidas,2023-12-10,"Los tenis son muy bonitos, muy contento con la compra, llegaron muy rápidos, todo muy cumplido"
Adidas,2024-01-10,"Me preocupaba la talla pero me quedaron bien, ahora solo queda ver su durabilidad.ActualizacionEn el 1er día de uso  y en la parte interna se desprendió la almohadilla. A un mes de uso la suela en la parte trasera se despegó y se agujereo. Pésimo"
Adidas,2023-12-04,
Adidas,2023-11-11,First day of wearing them…. Very comfortable on the feet.
Adidas,2023-12-15,Los tennis tienen defectos y se observa la pega
Adidas,2024-03-25,"They fit great, look great, at a good price."
Adidas,2024-01-23,"I really like these shoes. They fit perfectly and are very comfortable. Also, I like that my feet don't get cold in low temps as I've had that problem with other shoes."
Adidas,2024-03-07,"The gray on the front of the shoe is more of an off-white grey. Not dark grey like in picture. Shoes are comfortable, light, and fit to size."
Adidas,2024-03-12,"My foot is shaped like the shoe box, size 12 fits my foot better than the 11 I measure. ""Pointer feet"" probably fit as sized.  Bought these to help rehab my new knee and really like them.  Tread is great on the sandy, rolling trails I prefer to walk; shoe is all day wear comfortable.  Toe bumper protects toes on trails and the forefoot is beefed up to prevent ""big toe poke through"". Wasn't sure about the color but it works in my ""casual dress code"" office."
Adidas,2024-03-18,Nice and reasonable price.
Adidas,2024-03-19,Love fit and feel
Adidas,2023-05-03,"I hike/walk these days. I had thought that I would stick with the Adidas AX style trail hiking shoes I've had, but I just returned a new pair of AX2s because the toe box on those are just too cramped.These trail runners are better up front and down below have a sole design that is more stable because they flare out, especially around the heel area.  I rolled my ankle more often on trails with the AX versions I've had.  The AX hiking shoes are also more jolting, while these are nice and cushy.The one downside, the soles rubber is soft and wears rather quickly if you have to run/walk some paved roads to get to the trail.  That said, the rest of the shoe is very durable.  My tread worn pair is still fine otherwise, even after many twig pokes and rock scrapes.Also, once the tread wears down, they are still fine for street use.  I'm saving my old pair for times when I will just be walking paved roads and don't need knobs."
Adidas,2023-10-27,"Update: After causing too much foot pain from using the trail running shoes running on trails, I've gone back to my old pair of proper trail runners. Even with a new insole these are not good trail runners for narrow D feet. Relegated now to yard work duties.----------These are supposed to be trail running shoes which should feature a snug heel and a roomy toe box. These are just your basic slightly wide regular fit.My foot is a narrow D so these are not super comfortable on the trail. If you are  a normal or wider D these should feel pretty good.The traction on rock and slippery surfaces, however, is outstanding.May see about getting a thicker insole and wearing some thicker socks to get me a snug fit. For the price (on sale) still good value if you are a normal or slightly wide D"
Adidas,2024-03-29,Fits perfect and size is as expected.  Easy to break in and very comfortable for a full 18. Highly recommend!
Adidas,2023-10-17,"Great shoe, comfortable, stylish and such a great price.  Can’t go wrong with these golf shoes"
Adidas,2024-03-31,Like the looks and tread pattern. I agree with other reviewers that they are lacking padding on the top ankle opening. Definitely need socks taller than the shoe.
Adidas,2024-04-01,"These shoes not only feel great but look great. Was not sure about spikeless golf shoes, but got to wear these on the course and it’s just what I was looking for. There styling too."
Adidas,2023-09-17,"Super light, flexible, water proof. Just like my daily runners. These run 1/2 size small. Normally I wear 9.5 Adidas, exchanged for 10. Perfect. First day out, all day 18 holes, no problem. Easy on and off. Super cushy heal pocket, outta bounce I in your step, no slipping. Love 'em."
Adidas,2023-11-14,"Bought these for my husband, who had lost his golf shoes.  Great value, great fit, great shoes!"
Adidas,2024-01-15,The product delivered was exactly what I was expecting. Good price great quality.
Adidas,2024-03-07,These will run on the front of your lower ankle. Tall socks recommended
Adidas,2024-04-08,"Super comfy, almost sock-like. I read reviews that said people couldn’t get their feet into them, but I had no issue. Definitely would buy again"
Adidas,2024-04-07,"Great fit, comfortable and stylish. Love them!"
Adidas,2023-10-31,"Fit is a bit tight initially but that is expected from a fabric - if you have super wide front of foot or fat feet they may not work.  My son has normal width feet, kind of a high arch. They fit great - and bonus for any young man they add about 13/4 in height (not me judging, just know guys like height)"
Adidas,2024-03-16,They fit perfectly
Adidas,2024-04-15,I love adidas anything. Coolest part of these bad boys is they are obviously solid red. That's why I bought em. I love the look. They are comfy and fit well. If you are a show person like I am then owning a solid red pair anybrand is a must. Buy and enjoy. You will.
Adidas,2024-04-11,"10/10 recommend! Adidas always delivers. It's about quality, supporting their mission, vision and purpose and can we just admire the vibrancy of these shooes???"
Adidas,2023-10-03,"I found the fit significantly tighter than my other shoes of the same size plus I am 83 years old and putting them on when there is a continuous piece of the shoe fabric where there usually is a tongue makes it really difficult for me, particularly my left foot which is slightly swelled sometimes. Not being able to spread the lacing area of the shoes when putting on the shoe has made it just too difficult for me to do even with long shoehorns. Because they are tight (even though all my good fitting shoes are the same US size as these so they should fit well) walking in them is not pleasant. Also, after wearing them with their very thick sole in the back, I have to assume that they were not made for men but really were made for ladies used to walking in high heels. I am giving them away and definitely will not purchase this style of shoe again."
Adidas,2024-03-08,"The shoes look excellent. I ordered 5 pairs total attempting to find the correct size for myself and my son. Turns out the issue isn't the shoe size. It's the opening you put your foot in. It is massively undersized, and since it isn't a typical tongue style shoe it can't be loosened or adjusted. I'm not skinny, but my son is. Neither of us could find a comfortable size"
Adidas,2023-07-31,"I wanted some non expensive spike-less golf shoes that still looked good. I’ve always been a fan of adidas so these looked great! Playing 5 rounds with them so far has been great! Being that they’re spike less, they don’t have outstanding grip in rain/mud. However, they do wash off and clean up really nice. They’re also durable enough to wear to the course and walk around on concrete. They’re stylish enough to wear out if you go to Topgolf or something that. My only complaint is they’re a little warm for Texas 115 degree weather, but that doesn’t even take it down from 5 stars."
Adidas,2023-12-26,These are the most comfortable golf shoes I have ever owned. they feel like your wearing slippers. I highly recommend them.
Adidas,2023-07-06,I bought these shoes for a trip to Europe. They survived 10+ daily mile walks. My feet didn’t hurt at the end of the day either. Needless to say they are broken in.
Adidas,2023-08-03,"Read the fine print, this is not a sneaker."
Adidas,2023-11-29,got a great deal on BF. The price went up afterward. Glad that I bought one.
Adidas,2023-12-21,"These shoes are really comfortable and great for a range session or a day on the course. However, the grass must be dry. If you are playing in the early morning or with some rain, the grip on these soles will not do the job so stick to spikes if you deal with a lot of rain or like to play early in the morning. Otherwise these shoes are amazing. Good casual spikeless shoe that is arguably more comfortable than any other shoe I own."
Adidas,2023-06-22,Great shoe by far my favorite golf shoe yet
Adidas,2023-08-26,"These are comfortable and really nice looking. They are easy to clean and the quality is great, hard to be Adidas!"
Adidas,2024-04-02,The shoes are very comfortable
Adidas,2023-09-04,"Bought these to replace my old Adidas that I’ve worn for about 12-14 years after the sole came off.  These are almost identical, lightweight, great grip during swings, and extremely comfortable.  Size is perfect."
Adidas,2024-03-31,Getting harder to find golf shoes with changeable cleats! Well worth the money!
Adidas,2023-12-09,The shoe looks and performs fine but the materials are a little cheap and they crease where the toe bends in a very stiff and uncomfortable way that does not yet seem to be breaking in. So far I'm happy with them as other than that they are comfortable and they look good for the money but if they don't soften up in the crease they will continue to be very uncomfortable.
Adidas,2024-02-02,"Size was perfect, fast delivery (even for Puerto Rico). Great shoes for the price."
Adidas,2023-12-30,Absolutely amazing with a great grip in both dry and wet weather!!
Adidas,2024-01-24,"I have a very old set of Adidas Tech golf shoes and got these as a backup after regluing the sole of my older set.The fit is similar, but the materials feel cheaper. The best way I can describe it is that it feels like a cheap set of fake leather shoes - but not the whole shoe, just parts of it. Time will tell how it holds up, but my initial impressions are not great."
Adidas,2023-11-29,These are extremely comfortable on my high school golfer who walks 18 holes and Carrie’s his bag. They are sturdy and keep his feet dry in the morning dew.
Adidas,2023-12-15,This shoe design is great. The shoes fit my wide feet well. The shoe is light. I wear this shoe at work in an office clinic setting and it is comfortable on my feet all day long. Only gripe is that the shoe insole that it comes with wears out rather quickly.
Adidas,2024-03-31,nice
Adidas,2024-03-20,"I got this sneakers and few, also Adidas, similar stile and design.  This sneakers are super light, have no shoelaces and on gray color is hard to see dust or dirt. Only one problem is insoles,  they don't last too long, but you can get them for cheap on internet and they will be good quality.."
Adidas,2024-04-15,"These are wonderful if you plan on using them indoors for a few months and then replacing them again. They're like wearing comfortable socks. They're very nice and lightweight, but the issue lies within the bottoms of these shoes.. the traction.. It's already pretty thin so it won't take much to turn these into slippers. I really enjoy how stylish these are and how easy they are to use as walking shoes, but this one detail really hurts their credibility in my opinion. If it wasn't for all the positives, I'd drop it down further on my rating. During the few months that these shoes are in great condition, you will absolutely love them."
Adidas,2024-03-08,Son lives in these. Easy slip on and off with no wear to the back.
Adidas,2024-03-17,"As a mostly remote (at home) worker these are my new go-to 'office' shoes. They are very comfortable and can wear all day without issues. I haven't tried exercising in these shoes. Not sure if the tops, without laces, would be supportive enough."
Adidas,2024-01-08,"My husband and I are both amputees (my left leg, his right). We struggle big time with shoes, we have found that this shoe is easy to get on and off with the least amount of effort. Definitely a good purchase for us. The only con I have with this product is that there isn't a style available similar to this that is waterproof. If I could change anything about the shoe it would be just to make it hold up to the elements a bit better. we wear through them rather quickly because the material isn't as durable as it should be, in my opinion."
Adidas,2024-02-28,"Slip on running shoe.  I know that they should stay on, but they are very snug. Pulls your sock up when trying to get then on.  Once situated,  these shoes are very comfortable and light."
Adidas,2024-01-09,"These golf shoes are comfortable and provide good support.  They look like tennis shoes - as opposed to golf shoes. I did go up a half a size, and the fit is perfect.  The spikes are pretty large, and I feel like they kind of leave marks on the greens. I walk very carefully."
Adidas,2023-11-14,"These golf shoes are perfect!  They fit perfectly, I could walk all day in them as they are so very comfortable!  I will definitely purchase them again!"
Adidas,2023-10-02,"I'm newer to the sport of golf and needed a shoe to get me started. These shoes are very comfortable and have a great material to keep your feet dry! For the price, this is a great shoe to start with."
Adidas,2023-10-29,"Felt stiff but based on other reviews, it needs to be broken into. I haven't use this item on the golf course yet so I cannot say anything else about it."
Adidas,2024-01-09,toe is a bit narrow. - nice shoe!
Adidas,2024-03-31,I absolutely love these and they have became my favorite. I always order a half size larger in any golf shoe and these were no different. They are perfect.
Adidas,2023-11-27,I wore these new out of the box thus past weekend at Talamore Golf Resort. Golfed 3 days straight and these were the most comfortable golf shoes ever!  I would recommend anyone purchasing them. They were true to size.
Adidas,2023-08-30,Bought to have an extra pair of golf shoes. When I purchased them thinking they were not waterproof. Wore them last evening for league play thinking it wouldn't rain. WRONG! Downpour for 15 minutes. These shoes were WATERPROOF.  My feet were dry by the time I got to the clubhouse. Wonderful golf shoes for rain. Very comfortable. The size fit perfectly without getting a 7.5. wide.
Adidas,2024-01-08,"I've always been a fan of Adidas and the reason is they make comfortable quality shows at a great price. These are stylish, with god comfort, and a unique design.  I wasn't disappointed and they came in great condition and delivery was as expected. I can tell you how nice these shoes look and I've got my wardrobe in place already. What I like about these is that they're easy to slip on and off, they're, light weight, and they are a good fit. They have a nice hug around the ankle and they are true size so stick with my normal size and I have about 1/2"" cushion which gives me great comfort. You don't have to worry about the shoe coming off as it fits like a glove, so you can run, jump, or workout in these with no issues. The best thing about these shoes is the style, and then in a strong 2nd is the comfort. I own multiple pair of Adidas and these are just as comfortable as my older ones with a nice look. I don't have a call out for anything I didn't like I love Adidas and that's a fact."
Adidas,2024-03-24,Easy to put on. No laces to tie. Minimalistic simple design. Ordered the size 7.5 and it's true to size. Very comfy.
Adidas,2024-03-10,My original ultra boost got worn out for the years I had worn it. These fit true and is comfortable for a long period of time. As well as a great gym shoes
Adidas,2023-12-28,These are comfortable and great looking shoes.The slip on feature is nice and they feel tight on the foot once put on.I will advise to get at least a 1/2 size larger than a normal shoe. If the shoes are too tight in the toe you will see the outlines of your toes. It is not the best look!
Adidas,2023-12-10,"Very comfortable for everyday use, running, sports or gym use. They might have a tighter foot entrance than you're use to (if you haven't worn similar ones before) but not to worry, it's just tighter to make sure they stay on your feet. I have been buying this style of shoe from adidas for a few years now and I've been loving them. Very durable shoe as well. I've been using one of the pairs for 3 years as a work shoe (it's not one but I use it as one) and the shoe is in great condition considering it's a more labor intensive job and always on my feet. So I'd say these will last you a good amount of time and while having a good look and feel."
Adidas,2024-04-04,love the shoe very comfortable and extremely light weight
Adidas,2024-03-28,Wear these as my house shoes. Easy slip on. Very comfy. They are great.
Adidas,2024-03-28,My grandson loves them n says they are very comfortable
Adidas,2023-09-21,"After being in use of these for a couple months, these quickly became my favorite shoes in general above others! ADIDAS has always been my go-to shoes for just fashion and basic comfort, Forums in all forms are my personal favorite, and then I got these Grand Court 2s for long standing at work. All-in-all, I can best express my feelings to these as stylish, comfortable, and quite durable in the long run because they look great in basic all black and are the easiest to clean and shine after work. I often use these when I'm out shopping and visiting friends as well, I'm just that confident in these as comfort shoes and I have some decently wide feet as well. Since I have them in all black, the creases don't really show up when you are not actively looking for them, which is a plus and to add to that, it barely creases when casually walking. I was also told to size up by another half for better fitting, which I did, and I can still feel a bit of extra toe room as I slide my feet in.At the end of the day, it's definitely my favorite everyday shoes when I'm not over thinking about style and comfort. It's so good I would actually recommend this at base price, but I did catch these shoes at 30% lower so if it goes on sale, I wouldn't hesitate at the thought of buying these."
Adidas,2024-01-09,"I bought this court shoe for my husband to play pickleball on outdoor courts, and he likes it.  I would say it's true to size because he told my what size shoe he wears, I ordered that size, and he said it fits fine, no problems.  His feet are average width.  I call them his ""Run DMC"" shoes because it reminds me of the style of shoes Run DMC wore on MTV.  I can tell he loves the shoes because he is careful not to get them dirty and cleans them after every use.  He does not do that as much with his other athletic shoes.  He speculated that the shoes MAY have had some kind of slippery-type ""finish"" on the bottom of the shoes, because the first time he wore them, he slid on the court several times and actually fell, BUT the court may have had light/not visible moss on it from a prior rain.  He is very athletic so he didn't fall because he's old or out of shape.  Since that first time using the shoes about a month and a half ago, he hasn't slid or fallen since.  I knocked off a star for ""value for money"" because supposedly it was a deal at just under $63 but after that, about a month later, the price dropped to under $45.  I hate when that happens, ugh!  Anyway, I hope you found this review helpful because it's hard to buy shoes online since you can't try them on first."
Adidas,2024-04-14,I love my adidas Grand Court 2.0. I usually go with the Adidas Superstars but these are just as good withsome minor design differences. I did have to got up a a full size as they were a tighter fit than the Adidas Superstars. They are comfortable to wear and go with any outfit.
Adidas,2024-02-23,I tried the Air Force Ones but didn’t love the fit and they were difficult to walk in. These are a GREAT option for a similar look! Very comfortable to walk in and they fit perfectly to size.
Adidas,2023-08-02,"I love the look, the fit, and the comfort of Adidas shoes. These are attractive shoes, solid, white, with the three burgundy stripes. The only complaint that I have is that they arrived in a white bag with the shoebox inside. The shoebox was completely crushed and mangled. Not so much a problem for me, because it was going in the trash, but for some shoe collectors, the box is just as important as what’s inside."
Adidas,2024-04-07,Great product. I use them for work
Adidas,2024-04-02,Fit perfect great for anyone that wants a comfy cheap durable shoe
Adidas,2024-02-23,"Just what I expect from Adidas... A too quality shoe full of comfort and awesome looks. I have several pairs of Superstars and while I love them, especially for the old school look, these are definitely MUCH more comfortable. I mean, the in-sole is fantastic! Gel and crazy comfortable. I'll definitely be buying more"
Adidas,2024-02-29,"Just got these back after a year hiatus. Perfect shoes for basic, neutral stylin' around town. Pretty much will go well with anything your wearing. The soles are white and will last forever and don't scuff: they wear evenly well. I paid like $10 more at Shoe Carnival 3 years ago, so these are a steal and the price is still going down a week later. BUY these. They look good for at the beach, bar, work/office, airport.. I'm probably end up buying another pair for strictly inside around the house to keep the carpets clean, and one for nights on the town as these have been my everyday walking shoes. Downside is, the whitewalls of the soles of the shoes will show ANYTHING that get up there, so I'll wipe them with a Mr. Clean magic eraser once a week to keep them fresh looking (also, being former army, I know ""if you take care of your gear, your gear will take care of you"" 😋); also another reason I'm buying a pair for around the house, etc. Get them now, they are an investment and will last year's if you keep them clean. Will shrink slightly if you machine wash them. Air-dry with hairdryer or in the direst sun"
Adidas,2024-02-27,"I love these shoes. I thought I’d have to break these shoes in, but they fit perfectly and comfortably immediately. I typically wear a size 11, which is the size I purchased, and they were true to fit. These have a classic style that I can wear as everyday shoes. I’d absolutely buy another pair."
Adidas,2024-03-30,"They look nice and fit comfortably, perfect casual walking shoe."
Adidas,2024-03-03,"The insoles that come with these are barely thicker than construction paper, and offer zero support. Add your choice of quality insoles and you'll have a 5 star pair of shoes. This is the first time I have ever been disappointed in an Adidas product; I remedied the situation but wish I hadn't had to spend the extra money."
Adidas,2024-04-15,"I'm a teacher, so I'm on my feet a decent amount of the day and, so far, these shoes have been amazing. Incredibly comfortable with an almost molded soul, great tread, and stylish looking. I often get compliments from my colleagues and students (who can be very picky with what they like) on my shoes. These are my go to shoes for work or everyday now. Also a plus that it is a well known name like Adidas who has been making quality products for years and years now."
Adidas,2024-03-09,Fits true to size and don’t even have to break the shoe in. Great classic Adidas look. Completely satisfied with the shoes.
Adidas,2024-04-14,"I adore these shoes. For the price, they’re very comfortable and I love the way they look."
Adidas,2024-02-28,"I've been looking for something of a modern style mixed with a classic feel - this shoe is definitely it. It's comfortable, stylish, and i didn't break the bank buying a $100+ shoe. The shoe fits true to size in my experience and i have a wider foot. Would highly recommend!"
Adidas,2024-04-09,These were on sale so I thought to give them a try. Very light weight and comfortable. Had good ground contact and stability. Amazon recommended a half size larger which I did and they fit perfectly. I’m normally a 10.5 in men’s boots and shoes but 11 are just right. These have a really nice look and descent quality
Adidas,2024-03-03,"Love everything about these shoes.Best shoes I have ever owned.Lightweight, comfortable, functional and best of all a great price!"
Adidas,2024-03-19,"This was the first time I had bought this brand of golf shoes. They are very comfortable, and appear to be of very good quality. If I had a complaint, it would be that the soles retain too much dirt and are a little difficult to clean."
Adidas,2024-04-12,"I want to give these shoes a high rating but there is one downside to buying white, mesh shoes. In wet grass of a golf course, they will stain. I've not tried to wash them yet but I can easily see the sort of orange line about halfway up the front of the shoe caused by walking in tall grass (yes, I mean in the tall grass away from the fairway...where I frequently end up).Other than that, they are really good shoes. The gripping base holds the grass well even if it picks up and holds goose droppings and mowed grass.Very comfortable, good fit and very sturdy. I bought a size 14 and it's just right for my size 13 (or so) feet.I don't really pay  much attention to the staining as they're golf shoes and everyone's golf shoes show use.Good product."
Adidas,2024-03-18,"I haven’t yet had the chance to play a film round in them. However, for the price these are insanely comfortable and lightweight and the grip is phenomenal."
Adidas,2024-04-14,Very comfortable and looks great! Awesome price for the value!
Adidas,2024-04-11,"Feel great and have awesome grip on the course! I have a wider foot, and they fit just fine."
Adidas,2024-03-26,Fits true to size. Very comfortable shoe. Good value.
Adidas,2023-10-17,I love the style and fit of the shoe. Everything about them is great except that the insole of the shoe has worn down significantly in the heel and toes. All the way down to the fabric underneath. Other than that the shoes are great.
Adidas,2024-02-04,"Very comfortable. I normally order an 8 in sneakers, but it was unavailable in this color/style, so I opted to try the 7.5. It’s VERY wide around the heel, but the length is perfect. I’m returning them, but if the heel was more narrow, they’d definitely be keepers!!!"
Adidas,2023-01-29,"I love them,but they run too big. I usually wear an 8,but as I read in the reviews they run large I ordered a71/2,but they still big so I reordered a 7 and finally fit,so my advise is to get a number down"
Adidas,2024-03-23,"I’m absolutely in love with these sneakers !I’m wear them often and stay on top of keeping them clean & white.*Tip: Add a tiny bit of water slowly into a paste mixed with Dawn soap, baking soda, oxy clean and/or hydrogen peroxide. Brush on to clean, let air dry ir rinse and let air dry. Can also use a magic eraser on the soles but brushing works great"
Adidas,2023-08-21,"They are very nice, but they are not shoes to wear all day they have no arch support they are very stiff and the tongue doesn't stay flat you have to really pull and tug to be able to get them tied them. They are not for the ladies maybe for young kids . I bought them to replace an old adidas pair and they are not made the same anymore."
Adidas,2024-03-24,"Bought these for the color, style, and manufacturer. They're fine if you don't have to walk on rocks. The soles look thick but you can feel rocks thru the soles."
Adidas,2023-08-18,"Second pair because I love the first pair.  I need a wide toe box with thinner heal, and some arch support in a decent looking shoe.  These fit me so well.  Have tried 7 or 8 different styles this year and none of them fit me well or were cheaply made.  These shoes are very well made, good support with just the right outer sole thickness.  These are 9.5, I wear a 10 in other Adidas shoes.  I am an adidas fan but not impressed with this year's products, except these.  Size down a half size."
Adidas,2024-02-28,Ok so they are white ... I've prepared them with protectant and they are white sneakers. They seem to be true to size ... As they should be. They came on time ... Had to return a larger pair to then get a new pair but that went smoothly.Enjoy!  ~(*¿*)~
Adidas,2023-05-18,"Great shoe - not sure if I would label this a running shoe...maybe a walking shoe.  Casual.  I normally fit 10.5 and needed to get an 11, but worth the price."
Adidas,2023-03-11,A bit narrow but overall fantastic shoe.
Adidas,2023-06-24,"I got a pair of Adidas Nizza shoes for the same price that were very similar to these...at least it seemed. I just wanted a simple pair of white slip on shoes for sunny summer days. They are white, and slip on, but it gets pretty disappointing after that.The band on the side that is supposed to flex is more of a visual gimmick, which makes walking uncomfortable when it's combined with the shoe's unusual tight width.On the bright side- they'll stay clean for longer because I'll barely wear them. Realistically- I wish I had spent $10 more and gotten basic white shoes that I can wear without pain."
Adidas,2023-08-06,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Decently budget skate shoes which it was made for, elastic band pretty tight but in a skate sesh is manageable. Insole sucks. But the sole of shoe also grips to the board well which is what i want. Not made for walking shoes, get a pair of comfortable running shoes instead of these skate shoes."
Adidas,2024-04-15,I love the shoes. Great fit and great brand. So worth the money
Adidas,2023-08-02,"I have narrow feet and heels usually have problems with shoes coming loose at the heel and ankle area. I purchased these based on some of the reviews that stated that these shoes ran small/narrow. The problem is that the elastic appearing band at the arch of the shoe is actually not elastic and appears to be more of a cosmetic touch. Even with my narrow feet, I had problems getting my foot into the shoe without a fair amount of effort assisted by a shoe horn. The band is relatively rigid and places a great deal of constriction in the midfoot area and along the inner arch of the foot. Once my foot is in the shoe, this constriction is very obvious and yet the heel/ankle area remain loose. This is a very non-anatomically sized shoe. The length appears to be true to fit, its just this midfoot band that is extremely uncomfortable. Also, the sole of this shoe is very stiff. It is not at all flexible unlike what you would normally expect in a casual slip on shoe. I was very disappointed as I liked the cosmetics of the shoe. Unfortunately, I have to say that this is one of the most uncomfortable shoes that I have ever purchased. I should have heeded the negative reviews that talked about how uncomfortable these shoes are. I just thought that it was because people had purchased the wrong size shoe. However, it is the construction and design of the shoe that makes it ill-fitting and uncomfortable. Perhaps that is why they are discounted so much. I have owned several pair of Adidas shoes (in the past they tended to fit well as they tended to accommodate narrower feet like mine). However, this is the first Adidas shoe style that I could not wear (in the proper 8.5 size) due to extreme discomfort. Again, quit a disappointment as I thought that I could snag a “deal” as I really liked the sleek and clean look of the shoe. Will definitely be returning after just trying them on for 3-5 minutes."
Adidas,2023-04-30,These are comfortable but after a few months the insoles are deteriorating. It’s really weird. I’ve never seen a pair of shoes disintegrate like this.
Adidas,2024-03-29,Me gusto mucho por su comodidad
Adidas,2024-04-05,"I did like the comfort and protection for my feet, only draw back my shoe laces broke first time putting them on to tie the shoes. But replaced with white which all I had  but did work for the shoe. Less tired feet have noticed."
Adidas,2024-04-15,Fit was great and are holding together pretty good so farWas concerned about cloth but camp dry to be 100% every now and then and material is holding up better than expected
Adidas,2024-01-31,"They're great shoes, but I'm usually an 11.5 this shoe definitely runs small. Should have bought the size 12. Interesting has I have other Terrex products and fit fine as an 11.5."
Adidas,2023-12-13,"Adidas are the only brand I buy online because I know I won't have any fit problems. I wear a normal Size 10 and these fit as expected. They look cool and they are comfortable. Great traction and no issues so far. I will update this review should I have any issues when I put miles on these.Update 1: This is my second pair of Adidas Terrex shoes. My other pair are Terrex Skychaser LT GTXs. These AX4 are a little bit different. The toe box is a little bit more narrow. Not a problem for me, but keep this in mind if you have wide feet. Also, the sole and heel of the AX4 is much more firm. These are not squishy when you walk or run, but the sole is very supportive."
Adidas,2024-04-02,Great hiking shoe ! Has wonderful traction. Very comfortable and durable shoe
Adidas,2024-03-23,These shoes run small compared to other adidas. I’m typically a 9 men’s which translates to a 10 or 10.5 women’s and these fit super small my feet were hitting the front of the shoe. The shoe has a cool appearance but sadly don’t fit true to size.
Adidas,2024-04-13,Good for walking and running
Adidas,2024-03-17,This is a fair hiking shoe for the price I paid. It's a little snug but got more comfortable as I stretched them out. The black part of the heel has random white specks on them for some reason. For $59.00 it's a fair deal.
Adidas,2024-02-24,Love the ultra boosts. They hold up well. Super comfortable. Slide on and off and hug the feet. Use at the gym and for casual. Old pairs for hiking. Went with a little more color this time. Glad I did. I am typically between an 11.5 and 12. They fit true but the 12 is better for me. 11.5 definitely too snug.
Adidas,2024-03-11,"SOn loved them, comfortable, fast shipping."
Adidas,2024-02-27,would just like there to be a strap that makes them easier to put on like with the Yeezys.
Adidas,2023-11-12,"The shoes get more comfortable as you work them in, however they fit a bit tight around the toes."
Adidas,2023-11-20,"Perfect for running on dry roads.The shoe is a little narrow and squeezes a bit so it’s not the best for regular use.This is my second pair, they are well made and pretty durable if you are using them for it’s intended purpose. Ive used my first pair for 3 years and it’s still holding up.Great looking shoes and color way."
Adidas,2024-02-27,Extremely comfortable. Highly recommend.
Adidas,2024-04-01,Sneakers were already used and then terrible attempt to clean these garbage sneakers
Adidas,2024-02-25,Great shoes. My son wears them everyday
Adidas,2024-03-04,"I bought these because I am a huge fan of the old school Adidas. Not a fan of the new style logo !!! These were as close to old school as possible. Only thing that would have made them better would be the old school original logo on them.  Highly recommend these . Very comfortable, love the look ,fit and the price wasn't bad at all"
Adidas,2024-04-10,"Love, love, love these shoes!!  I was so surprised to feel how comfy these shoes are!  Very cute for that relaxed look!"
Adidas,2024-03-17,Love these shoes! Fit is good and they are super cute!
Adidas,2024-04-10,Love these sneakers
Adidas,2024-04-09,Took awhile to receive but perfect condition
Adidas,2024-03-12,Good fit
Adidas,2024-04-05,I bought these for myself. They are incredibly comfortable. They go with everything. My daughter ended up stealing them so I had to buy a second pair. They are an amazing value.
Adidas,2024-03-28,"Loved this look of these but I ended up returning because they weren’t the right size for me. I needed a wider, larger size. I think these were marked as men’s when I bought them, but they felt like a women’s size."
Adidas,2024-04-07,"These are definitely good running shoes that are very comfortable and well made o durable material. Also very reasonable on the value. I think they run a little small, but overall they are very good shoes."
Adidas,2024-04-10,These shoes look and feel great. Very light and comfortable. True to size.  Fit perfectly.  Will definitely buy these again.
Adidas,2024-03-08,"These are essentially a slip-on shoe, that tighten with the laces.  If you do not have a slim foot, getting yours into the shoe might not be very fun.  Luckily, there are large loops on the heel and what I would call the tongue.  These secure loops allow you to insert something that you can then pull up on.  For instance, I put a large screwdriver through one and a spoon handle in the other so I could pull up on the heel as well as the tongue to wrestle my foot into the shoe.  Once I finally got my foot into the shoe, it felt normal.  It did not feel too tight or uncomfortable.I have now worn the shoe for 72 hours straight as I can not remove it.  Just kidding, I was finally able to get it off with the help of my wife pulling on it like a tight boot.If you have ""chubby"" feet or just feet that are a little thicker than others, I would avoid this shoe at all costs.  Hope this helps you!Cheers!"
Adidas,2024-03-19,My son loves these.  They don't last super long - but that's to be expected; they're lightweight and mesh-like.  They take a beating pretty quickly.  But they look great and they're super comfortable.
Adidas,2024-03-04,"Do yourself a favor. If you have wide feet like I do, you’re going to love these trainers. They fit comfortably from day one. No painful breaking in. No tight ( or hot ) spots. As a bonus they look amazing."
Adidas,2024-03-19,Overall the shoes are great! Little tight on the tongue part only cause it’s not a tongue haha. Would buy again! Green ones look the best!
Adidas,2024-04-10,"I bought these exclusively for the gym based on another review.  They have a firm sole / feel that's good for weight-lifting stability, but they're also comfortable enough for the treadmill or biking.  I don't think I would try to run for any real distance in these though.....JMO."
Adidas,2024-03-19,"These are the brightest white, most stylish, most comfortable goes with every casual outfit shoe I’ve ever owned. Of course it was made by my fav brand. Absolutely love the logo design for the shoe. I will say this is absolutely a shoe that should be sprayed with waterproof spray multiple times before wearing."
Adidas,2023-11-08,"I went back and forth on these for a while before deciding to finally buy them. So glad I did! They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn! These shoes wear all day on the course and then to run some quick errands perfectly! No breaking in needed! I wish I had just bought them earlier! They don’t get dirty, they are super comfortable and look great with every outfit! Would highly recommend to anyone on the fence about them. Also, bought my true size and they fit perfect!"
Adidas,2024-01-15,"Love it, very comfortable walking around. Not to mention Cute!!! Pink is more peachy than picture."
Adidas,2023-10-15,Super comfy fit and very clean looking golf sneakers! Not heavy so you can wear them when you walk the course! Easy to clean waterproof! Works great on the course.
Adidas,2023-06-17,I just started golf and wanted a basic golf shoe. I think these are perfect for beginners! They are cute and comfortable. I will say I wish I would have sized down half. I am usually an 8.5 but they are a little loose in the toe and around the ankle.
Adidas,2024-03-05,This is such a good looking golf shoe. It also looks really good off the course.
Adidas,2023-10-07,Super comfy and perdition fit! Love that they can be worn off the course as well.
Adidas,2023-09-09,"Perfect fit, love these shoes"
Adidas,2023-08-16,Great shoes and comfortable! Even for walking the course these were great!
Adidas,2024-04-09,"Great casual adidas shoes. Very comfortable with good cushion and support. I got them on sale for $45 which is a great price for these shoes……frankly what they should have cost considering they’re normally $75! I’m a man and the 9 1/2 fit true to size. I read some reviews saying they were fake or sized wrong, didn’t have problems with the quality or size. Highly recommend."
Adidas,2024-04-09,"I typically wear New Balance cross-training style shoe. I wanted a pair of navy blue suede Converse one stars. I couldn’t find what I was looking for. I bought these and similar style New Balance suede shoes. The New Balance didn’t fit as well as these, so I returned them. These are very comfortable and they look great. Too bad they didn’t have a navy blue suede available."
Adidas,2024-03-28,"Great shoes, right size as described"
Adidas,2024-03-12,"These Adidas VL Court sneakers are satisfying to me. They have a nice, smooth, sleek, and minimalist profile that i admire. I don't like to be too showy with my shoes, and these fit that bill.  They are relatively comfortable also. Their minimalist profile make them easy to use for driving small cars with tight footwells. I wish the uppers were real leather, however, I don't mind them being synthetic since i will use them for everyday use. Now, I can only hope that the uppers don't separate from the soles due to adhesive deterioration as several shoes have done in the past. At this point, i would recommend these shoes to all."
Adidas,2024-04-10,"I love these shoes and haven't stopped wearing them since I got them! They did chafe the back of my foot the first day, but nothing a couple of band-aids couldn't handle. Other than that, they have been very comfortable, and they were also really easy to clean after I got caught in the rain. I should get them in other colors!"
Adidas,2024-04-10,"All that snickers with front tip wrapping up and top made of fabric so borring and annoing. Leather and flat soul , forever!!"
Adidas,2024-01-02,Very nice and fit perfectly
Adidas,2024-04-11,"Fits me perfectly, color and style look great and love how vivid the green is."
Adidas,2024-04-09,We love these shoes. This is my daughters second pair because she grew out of the 1st ones. They are perfect for her feet and true to size. She can walk around all day in these and she never takes them off.
Adidas,2024-02-14,These Adidas are well made. My 8 year old wears them to school a couple days a week between these and her crocs. They still look new and easy to clean.
Adidas,2024-04-06,"ADIDAS toddler sneakers often run small and narrow, but this sneaker fit perfect on my toddlers wide foot.  No more tears while trying to but sneakers on!  Will be buying other styles!"
Adidas,2024-03-23,"These shoes were such a disappointment!!! My son used these for school only and within a week one of the Adidas straps were peeling off. I ended up just cutting it off. I should have returned them, but my son became attached to them and wanted to keep them. I definitely would not buy them again or recommend anyone else to buy them."
Adidas,2024-03-22,My grandson likes them and they look good on his feet and he says they are comfortable
Adidas,2024-02-09,My daughter loves these shoes and says they’re very comfortable. My only complaint would be the laces will not stay ties. They are fairly thick and even a double knot tends to come loose.
Adidas,2024-03-15,This is the 5th pair of this style shoe that I believe I have bought for my almost 5 year old since she’s started walking. Love them
Adidas,2024-03-20,"These are nice except one shoe came with the Velcro not stitched to the shoe so it wouldn’t stay on. An easy fix if you having a sewing kit handy, but just seems really sloppy overall."
Adidas,2023-07-31,"I have been looking for months for a solid white golf shoe, and I finally found the perfect pair!  I normally can wear a size 7.5 in men's shoes, and a size 8.5 in women's shoes.  I purchased these in size 8, and they fit perfectly.  They are listed in men's golf shoes, but they are the exact same shoe as the Adidas Zoysia women's golf shoe, you just need to order a half size down from your normal women's shoe size."
Adidas,2023-08-15,I'm not one of these husbands that plays golf to get away from my wife.  There's no one I enjoy being with more than the lovely missus and I actually have been trying to get her to learn to play golf so we can go to the top courses of the world while we're traveling.  She was hesitant at first but she signed off on the plan when I told her that it would require a brand new wardrobe.Her first requirement was 'cute shoes' which I amended to 'cute shoes that will be decent to play golf in'.  She made it clear that she didn't want anything that looked like the golf shoes at the thrift store which I think are the only ones she's ever seen.  No problem with that here--these are great looking adidas shoes featuring the retro 1990's pale yellow color that has been making a strong comeback.  She hasn't actually started to wear them golfing yet but she loves the way they look and how they fit.  She's a big fan of adidas products in general so they've single handedly made her excited about learning to play golf.  Good job!
Adidas,2023-08-01,"The shoes are remarkably well-constructed with no flaws visible on both the upper or lower.  The sole offers the spikeless full-grip pattern, and plenty of diamond-shape mini treads to hold you and your game securely to the ground.This shoe design has mesh over the toe box and near the end of the foot, and is not waterproof, but all other areas of the shoe appear to be waterproof, and easy to clean at the end of a round.  Overall, definitely the quality level one would expect from Adidas.Shipment arrived in a bag, never a good look for me when receiving a pair of pricey shoes where I might want to use the shoe box for storage.  Upon opening, the shoe box was completely smashed, so no storage box.  The shoes were well-protected and in great shape.  This item does not fall into the ""fast replacement"" category, only return and rebuy."
Adidas,2023-12-03,Toobig
Adidas,2023-09-03,I thought I was getting a white golf shoe with a touch of orange. There is way too much gold details for me. Other than the color these shoes are very comfortable. So I’m going to order the pure white version
Adidas,2023-08-25,Its a nice pair of shoes and they are true to size! Ho for it!
Adidas,2023-08-18,"So, the shoe itself looks really nice. It feels cushioned and comfy, and it seems like it would be a really great golf/walking/whatever shoe. Unfortunately I ended up with a UK 6.5 instead of a US 6.5 so they are too big, which is a bummer, because they’re very cute I a great color combo!"
Adidas,2023-08-15,"I have the pink version of these shoes and the shade of color is lighter than in the product photos. Quality and craftsmanship look great, but I ordered a 6 and received a 7 1/2. Also, different colors are more affordable than the pink version."
Adidas,2024-04-01,"My husband is pretty picky about sneakers and I wanted him to have some that are neutral to wear with multiple things and he really likes these! We didn’t get them for working out necessarily, just for when we do lots of walking while traveling. He wore them for the first time on our week long trip last month and we walked about 10k steps a day and he said they were extremely comfortable all week long!"
Adidas,2024-02-24,"This shoe feel great and is very stylish, the only CON not as much traction on the sole."
Adidas,2024-02-23,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Son muy cómodos y los uso para entrenar en la caminadora y no me sudan los pies. Ya compré los blancos también para variar el color."
Adidas,2024-02-08,"I prefer to purchase Adidas running shoes in part because they almost always fit me perfectly. These are no different. The fit is perfect and that makes them very comfortable when I run. Thus far, my only issue with the shoes are the tongues.  I need to adjust them before I tie my shoes. They will get bunched up if I don't do that. That is my only issue with the shoes."
Adidas,2024-02-07,these Adidas shoes are amazing. Feel comfortable A+ plus seller will continue to buy.
Adidas,2024-01-14,"My husband loves these shoes for walking. True to size, very comfortable and great price."
Adidas,2024-01-12,What can you say it’s an Adidas quality shoe all the way around
Adidas,2023-11-30,Perfect
Adidas,2024-04-16,Like walking on air!  Great value and look good.
Adidas,2024-03-20,"Supportive, good shoes. A little awkward to put on at first, but fit like a glove."
Adidas,2024-04-06,This is my third pair. Great for running and for casual wear.I usually wear 12 but 12.5 is better for me in this style.
Adidas,2024-02-29,"Bought for my 12 year old son who is disabled so he can't tie shoes was hoping these would be better but there very hard to get on because the ankle area is a Lil small, but besides that great shoes for the price"
Adidas,2024-04-11,"Fits true to size, its comfy, pretty basic shoe"
Adidas,2024-02-16,"Thanks to Travel and Leisure online magazine for recommending an Adidas running shoe - I couldn't find the specific one recommended and instead chose this Men's Lite Racer Adapt 5.0 Running Shoe: it did not disappoint! These are by far some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned: they are slip-ons, make excellent walking shoes, and are almost perfect for a treadmill run (""almost"" because they somewhat feel like slipping off but never actually do). In the many miles of walking or running on them, I have yet to have swollen feet (a little expected soreness maybe, but never swollen) and I almost do not notice having the shoes on. They are also very breathable. Finally, for the price I paid, they go from excellent to an outstanding value!"
Adidas,2024-03-02,"Excellent sneaker for the price. Easy slip on , no tie. Also comes in wide. Have wide feet abd Nike sneakers I always return. They seem to be be made for a 2 inch wide foot. Buying again. My go to sneakers from Adidas"
Adidas,2024-04-13,"These shoes are light and very comfortable in my opinion. Just slip them on and you’re in business. I wear them for everyday walks, hikes, and even at work."
Adidas,2024-04-13,"Overall, quite happy with these shoes. They are comfy, light and quite stable! Which is not the case with some of the recent Adidas running shoes - they have flip up outsole in heel area on the outside.These shoes are very good, was able to even hike in them on a muddy trail!  The only dis-advantage is that the material in the heel area started to peel off on  the inside post 1 year of wear."
Adidas,2024-04-05,"The quality is very good, light weight, and has good air flow. It has very good air flow that water will soak right thru. Not recommended to wear in rainy day."
Adidas,2024-02-29,They fit good and are comfortable.
Adidas,2024-03-22,Nothing to dislike. A wear a 11 & a half shoe size. Very comfortable and good looking shoes. Great value from a trusted shoe brand.
Adidas,2024-03-30,I bought 2 pair of shoes at the same time and find myself wearing these more.  I have a new everyday shoe with these.  Incredibly comfortable!
Adidas,2024-03-10,These fit my wide foot perfect. Very good walking shoe. Feet stay cool all day.
Adidas,2024-03-25,I really like these shoes. I'm a very active 287 lb man and cover a lot territory every day. These shoes have held up well and my feet dont hurt at the end of the day.
Adidas,2024-03-05,"So normally I don't post a review of shoes until they have to be replaced, that way I can comment on the longevity and such. But these shoes have inspired me, so to speak.I have been wearing them for a couple weeks, and they were very comfortable right off the bat, nice fit, good support, and all that. I wear my sneakers around work, as well as on my 2 mile walk on lunch break. So far, so good.But! Today I finally took my walk on wet ground and I am very disappointed with these shoes.It should be noted that:1. It was NOT raining although there was an on and off mist.2. I did NOT step in any puddles, or visible standing water, just wet ground.Still, I did not even get halfway through my two mile walk before my socks were noticeably WET. Just from whatever water my steps were throwing. No puddles, no nothing. My pant legs right above the shoes were barely affected. At the end of the entire walk, I can feel water squishing in my shoes.I don't know if it's because of the mesh material on top letting the water in, or what. What I do know is that the shoes I just got rid of, that had visible holes in the canvas after 2 years of daily wear, did not get my socks this wet.If you are planning to wear these shoes around the house, or work, or to the gym, they could be very comfortable, which is why the 3 stars. Maybe I am misusing these shoes for their original intent, but I kind of feel like ""shoes"" should be able to be worn ""outside"" at a minimum."
Adidas,2023-09-21,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 This is the second pair of these Adidas that I have owned because I love the first pair so much and they were out after about a year. These are very affordable comfortable and go with everything."
Adidas,2023-09-10,Me encanto muy bonitos y cómodos
Adidas,2023-07-10,"I like the style, I love how lightweight they are but they rub my heals bad!"
Adidas,2023-07-23,"I have constant foot pain. Adidas and Skechers seem to be the only shoes that have very cushioned insoles that make the pain bearable. I specifically searched for Adidas with cloud foam insoles and these shoes Adidas Women Lite Racer 3.0 came up in the search. I loved the way these looked and was happy to see they were made out of recycled materials so I purchased them. Unfortunately, when I went to lace them I could tell immediately that the insoles were NOT cushioned. In fact they were EXTREMELY hard. I was heartbroken as I had thought I found the perfect shoes for work. Worst part is I got sick and missed the return window so now I am stuck with these brand new shoes that I cannot wear. I love an support that Adidas are looking into sustainable products but wish they had kept the cloud foam insoles. I've searched for other Adidas with cloud foam and have not had much luck finding ones I like and can wear to work. It seems to me they are veering away from cloud foam insoles. Very disappointing."
Adidas,2023-07-30,They were great for the price
Adidas,2023-10-18,"My daughter loves these shoes but this is the second time I have bought them and the foot bed insert cracks within the first 3 days of wearing them. The inserts say ""recycled material"" so I'm not sure if this is the issue or what."
Adidas,2022-10-08,"Item was delivered within reasonable time, kind of cute if you squint really hard. However, it looks really fake. This was not made in china it was made in someone’s backyard using a 3D printer. My apologies to the vendor but not cool. The box was all damaged, an elastic band was used to keep the box from opening. Disappointing."
Adidas,2024-01-02,Seems very bad quality. No heel comfort.
Adidas,2024-04-07,"I would say they are as cute as can be, and extremely comfortable , true to size . Great for walking."
Adidas,2024-03-28,"I also bought a pair of Reebok walking sneakers, but there's absolutely no comparison to my new Adidas! They looked & felt very bulky and heavy. And hot. These are simply a pleasure to wear! At home I always have my comfy slippers on. After I tried on Adidas Runfalcon 3, I wore them around the house awhile, and much later realized I still had them on. Sooooo comfortable, like a lite, very comfy cloud. They could be just a tad smaller, but I have RA, so it's much better than tight. It's actually perfect for me. Comfortable, lite weight, good support and looks good! Love them! :)"
Adidas,2024-02-14,I literally love these sneakers.  So comfy for walks and working out.  Super cute and the price is amazing.  I wear these all the time and will probably purchase again.
Adidas,2024-04-11,"I bought a pair for my daughter, she normally wears a size 8 for her other running shoes (Brooks), the 8's were too big so I had to exchange them for a 7.5, she doesn't own any shoes smaller than an 8.  But, the size 7.5 was a great fit with this shoe. She said they were super comfortable, and they looked great on her feet!"
Adidas,2024-03-07,"Color looks SO cute, and so light weight so they are comfortable to wear for long days!"
Adidas,2024-02-06,Good value for money. Nice and confortable.
Adidas,2023-12-30,This s the best sneaker I have ever had!  The wide heel gives me the stability for walking.  I generally walk a couple of miles daily and on city streets.  The size 6 is a perfect fit.  Very comfortable.  I wish I had found this sneaker a long time ago.  Thank you Adidas
Adidas,2024-03-13,"Opened the box, and the first thing I see is the this security  tab left on the  shoes.  How in the world did someone forget  to take that off? Thankfully  it was easy to cut of with bolt cutters. But honest what if someone didn't have bolt cutter?  Unfortunately  I'm not impressed.. it's not professional. Shoes are comfortable  and I'm perfect condition  very pleased."
Adidas,2024-03-01,"I like these a lot. Well rounded and hug your feet like a glove, but for your feet though!The way they look and feel are both amazing. Always been an adidas fan and for the price definitely worth every penny. The quality is there although I’ve only wore them for about a month and have yet to play basketball or run around in them.Overall a great purchase!"
Adidas,2023-10-03,"I Like everything about these Slick looking shoes!! I know the colors are wild, but I'm bored to tears with black and white, blue and white, and oh look Red and white athletic shoes! Well designed, comfortable, light  ,stop on a dime bb shoes for me! Very impressed!"
Adidas,2023-04-27,"Overall good shoe.Pros:Very good traction,lockdown,lateral support , stability,and ok Cushion.Durable enough to play outdoors on occasion but I wouldn't recommend as your primary outdoor shoes.Bounce Cushion is decent especially in the heel .Cons: Although cushion is decent playing indoors it just wasn't enough cushion for me. Since I have knee issues.It's a little heavy compared to most modern day BBall shoes. If you are using something like the Curry 9 or JA1 then switch to these you will definitely notice the weight difference.Ventilation is poor and gets very warm .Overall good shoe,I think if you are a shifty guard like Trae Young or a younger player, or have healthy knees and ankles these will be worth trying."
Adidas,2024-01-23,They are very good and beautiful.
Adidas,2024-03-22,Fit more comfortable than other Adidas.
Adidas,2024-04-01,We got these for my daughter for basketball and they look awesome! I want to wear them. They fit well and have really good traction.
Adidas,2024-02-21,"I’ve been looking for a new pair of Adidas because my normal pair was discontinued. I really like these as gym shoes and for lifting. Wouldn’t recommend for running, not enough cushioning."
Adidas,2023-10-22,Great style and comfort. Buy it.
Adidas,2024-02-01,"Got these for my 8yr old, he loves them! Good looking shoe & he says they're super comfortable, too!"
Adidas,2024-02-04,Comfortable and good quality. My son loves them!
Adidas,2023-08-28,Great fit and comfortable for my son. Holding up well.
Adidas,2024-04-06,My kid loves them
Adidas,2024-03-24,Comfortable true to size
Adidas,2024-02-16,Great grip for kids learning about golf
Adidas,2024-01-31,Grandson loves them!
Adidas,2023-08-10,Just what we needed
Adidas,2024-04-13,"I bought these for my daughter to have for golf season, and they were great! The quality was great for the price, they are comfortable, and they are very cute! They are good for golf or just to where anywhere. They really held up during her season, and helped keep her feet comfortable when walking in long tournaments."
Adidas,2024-04-08,I have wide feet and these fit perfectly. Comfortable and great price.
Adidas,2024-02-19,"Comfortable, true to size chart. Color just as in picture."
Adidas,2024-02-18,"I’ve been scouring trying to find the perfect sneakers, these feel and look great. They do hug the inside of your ankle, but lace placement and just wearing them out can help fix that. They offer arch support and the fact that they’re made out of rubber and not foam is a huge plus in my book. They also have a protective barrier around the toes and sides of the feet to keep the net from tearing. I got the purple and gray ones and they’re really cute."
Adidas,2024-04-10,Nice fitting - good style. Would buy again!
Adidas,2024-04-06,"After doing research on an affordable golf shoe for a beginner, I found the best price here on Amazon.  Very comfortable shoe without spikes.  Look like regular sneakers.  Very happy with them!"
Adidas,2024-03-18,"Good fit, durable and light"
Adidas,2024-02-26,"These shoes looked nice, fit well, and were comfortable, but I wore these all last summer, and if the course was at all wet, so were my socks and feet. Something about these shoes pulls the moisture up into the shoe."
Adidas,2024-03-18,I wear a size 8 shoe and found that these are true to size. I was worried that they would be flat or uncomfortable but not at all! I wore them to the gym (60min) and then went grocery shopping with them and my feet did not hurt once. I am currently wearing them at work. I love how I feel some compression around the curve of my foot and the top strap makes them feel secure as well. I also love how they are slip on AND stylish!!I bought the black ones with the white and pink sole. Buy them! :)
Adidas,2024-03-27,"These are so comfortable and slips right on. I use it every day for work, as I do a lot of walking. My feet don’t ache and the cushioning inside is wonderful. Love that I don’t have to stop what I’m doing to re-tie my shoelaces. They’re also easy to clean."
Adidas,2024-03-27,"Fits true to size, comfortable, stylish, wore them for the first time for a trip I took that had tons of walking and I never blistered. Would absolutely buy another pair."
Adidas,2024-01-04,"I was looking for a slip-on shoe to replace my Skechers GoWalk shoes. I like to go for quick walks through my neighborhood and like the slip-on vs. laced running shoes.These were affordable and thought it would be a step up in brand name. Sorry Skechers! I own a pair of women's 9 Adidas Court shoes that could've sized down with. Based on that and the other reviews for the Puremotion Adapt on sizing down, I ordered a women's 8.5. Holy tight and narrow! I would consider my feet to be normal width. The 8.5's were extremely hard to get on and the shoe felt narrow. Thankfully with free returns, I swapped them out for a size 9. Still a struggle to get on but more room in the toe box & still a bit narrow. I'm hoping with wear, this all will improve. Out of the box, no rubbing or blisters. This is a huge plus compared to all of the Skechers GoWalk shoes I've purchased in the past (definite blisters from the breaking-in period).As for support and cushion - I disagree with other reviewers. Yes, there is some memory foam in the sole. But not a lot and very little arch or heel support. I can't imagine using these shoes for running. I like the looks of them. I wear them without socks. If you wish to wear socks, I would size up!Affordable, stylish but tight and could use more arch support and cushioning!"
Adidas,2024-03-27,"These shoes are cute and very comfortable, great work shoes."
Adidas,2023-09-25,"This is my second pair. I bought my first pair a year and a half ago at Nordstrom Rack and they are so comfortable. I wear them to work and I stand/walk 8 hours on concrete. I switch these out with another pair of Adidas to change up my look and they held up for a year and a half. I got these because my last pair were looking a little gnarly. Still wear the old pair for long walks. Aside from work I generally walk between 3 — 6 miles almost daily just to give you an idea how much wear these get.Also, I should note I have Morton’s Neuroma which is a sharp pain with nerve damage between the 3rd and 4th toe from wearing narrow toed high heels for most of my adult life. If I don’t have the right shoe I cannot run, walk, or stand for long periods of time without pain.Besides being comfortable they’re a good looking shoe. I get complimented on them a lot.I’m between an 8 to 8.5 in shoe size, but because I have a wider foot and walk long distances for exercise, and get around 14,000 steps just at work my feet tend to swell so I purchased size 9 in store after trying size 8.5.They are a little big in the toe box, but not sloppy big. I needed the extra wiggle room due to swelling from being on my feet all day. The 8.5 would’ve been fine for casual wear. Also, they are designed to be worn with or without socks. I wear these without 100% of the time. I just spray my feet with dove deodorant and slip these puppies on and I’m good to go."
Adidas,2024-02-22,"It took me almost 10 minutes to get my feet into these shoes, the first time I tried them on. And now it takes like a couple of minutes. Wearing any kind of shoes should not take more than 30 seconds in my opinion. The problem is with the flexible back heal which turns inwards while you're getting into them. Once on, very comfortable!"
Adidas,2024-03-27,"Finding sneakers that are both stylish and comfortable is not a simple feat. Take advantage of these Adidas without any regrets. Not only does the cloudfoam provide comfort and arch support but the inclined design (admittedly surprising initially) of this specific style is a game changer! No back pain, no knee pain, no foot pain, just all day support and relief that it was money well spent!"
Adidas,2024-03-13,"Bought them because previously been using NMD R1.I like this due to a good quality(no issues with fabric, thread), nice comfort, they feels a little bit loose at the heel, but i think it is ok. They are really light and i link the idea that “boost” material is grinded so it will be more easier to remove dirt."
Adidas,2024-03-17,Very comfortable and beautiful
Adidas,2024-03-22,"Good quality, support and very light."
Adidas,2024-01-05,Only problem I had was they are tight to get on.
Adidas,2024-04-04,I thought this was not original but they are. It feels a really confort shoe and good materials. I love this shoe and I will see how the are for running specially.
Adidas,2024-02-16,"Walking all day on concrete in a warehouse style setting, these guys feel amazing. Super light and such cushion it feels like, yep, clouds.They fit like a glove on your feet. (May feel like a tight fit it you’ve never had an ultraboost style shoe from adidas.)If you’re a runner or someone whom is on their feet all day, this style shoe is the move."
Adidas,2023-12-04,"I bought these for my son.  While they may be comfortable on him, the quality of the shoe is horrible.  The soles are “painted” black versus how they used to be made with black silicone/plastic.  The paint has begun to chip off and the sneakers look old even though I only bought them 2 months ago.  Don’t waste your money on this sneaker."
Adidas,2024-02-26,"I now have 3 pair of these, they are super comfy and give great support.  I have bad feet and constantly fighting plantar fasciitis.  These are well made shoes and my new fave!"
Adidas,2024-03-30,Hard to find size 15 golf shoes and the price was excellent. Shoes are very comfortable and perfect for my grandson.
Adidas,2024-03-27,Great price. Adidas shoes last longer and are comfortable.
Adidas,2024-04-06,"Im a size thirteen with a bit wider foot, and these are super roomy.  So much that I would say I probably needed a 12.5.  The end result is there is a clicking when I walk.  This is because the material is like a coated cloth, it isnt mesh and it isnt leather.  Definitely a stiffer water resistant material.  When it flexes it makes crinkle or click sound.  And I have so much room it can flex a lot.I wanted the boa fastener to ease my back when tying shoes, plus I dont want my shoes to come untied during a round.  With that said, it is difficult to pull these laces tight at the toe.  You can get it tight at the top by the ankle, not as much down lower.  Also, the boa still works loose over the round.  It doesnt come undone, but it does loosen up.These are comfortable on the soles of your feet, however typical with adidas that will flatten out quickly.  I think these shoes would be ok for rounds with a cart.  I dont think they would be great for walking rounds.  The spikeless soles work great and allow for excellent leverage without digging up the greens or tee boxes."
Adidas,2024-03-23,"Very comfortable shoes.  They run a bit wide, which I personally love. Was skeptical of the boa design at first, but have come to appreciate it now that I'm used to it. No more having to worry about them coming untied.  They are perfect for wet weather play. Very first time I wore them was after a lot of rain had fallen and my feet stayed completely dry."
Adidas,2024-02-22,"In my experience I cannot beat these for comfort, fit and waterproofness.  I've had the very expensive golf shoes with 2 yr waterproof warranties to the price value shoes.  At one time I even tried Goretex hiking shoes to comfort and waterproofness.  Bu these have been the best, especially for the price.I just bought two more pairs after two and a half years with another pair.  I play twice a week and always walk year round."
Adidas,2024-02-21,"I had a different color of these exact shoes for a year, they were awesome, but using them everyday eventually they gave in to the stress of wearing feet lol.. It was time to get a new pair. These are direct replacements of a different color. Everything I expected!"
Adidas,2023-12-17,"My second pair in a different home. I found these shoes at a pro shop at a really nice golf course and couldn’t believe they were under $100 so had to try them. They are an odd material but so light, so comfortable and so waterproof. I am a devout BOA user so finding BOA laces on an Adidas shoe for $75 is crazy - love them!"
Adidas,2024-02-10,The shoe fits comfortably and the shoe tie harness does a good job.
Adidas,2024-02-15,Our daughter plays basketball and these have been great. Solid support for her ankles and great on the court. Great purchase for the price.
Adidas,2024-02-07,"Shoes look great BUT my son complains they hurt his feet every time he wears them. Maybe it's just him, IDK, but an honest review."
Adidas,2024-02-19,Excelente!
Adidas,2023-12-15,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Great quality! I ordered a size 5 for my 10 y/o daughter. Fit as expected. Comfortable and cute. Way cuter than expected. My daughter is so pumped to wear these for her very 1st tournament tomorrow. Worth every penny!"
Adidas,2024-03-27,"First, I don’t wrestle. I got these for martial arts. Second, I’m a female so I was nervous about the correct sizing etc. I measured my feet (and surprise it my typical everyday shoe size) and picked both my exact size it landed on and the very next half size up since that’s what I do for hiking and running shoes and ordered both to try on. I tried them on with and without socks. They fit perfectly. MAYBE the exact size is a hair snug along my pinky toe but I couldn’t see that being a big issue as the material will like relax a bit with wear. I’m going to wear both on the mat today and next week and see if I can even tell a difference in comfort. At home I was able to perform my routines etc comfortably in both. Cannot speak to longevity yet of course but I am not seeing anything “cheap” or with obvious weak points yet. I will say if you have truly wide feet then I’d look for your size in wide. Hope this helps since I’m always nervous buying shoes without trying them on first."
Adidas,2024-01-08,"My 11 year old (yes a big kid) has no issues with these wrestling shoes. They are in great condition still and its almost finished this season. I am sure he will wear them as ""normal"" shoes after, he is growing and will need a different size next season and these are comfortable."
Adidas,2024-02-03,My son went thru 3 pairs before he found this pair and he said they were comfortable but most importantly….they stayed together. His other ones fell apart. They look great as well. He said he would recommend these
Adidas,2023-11-09,"I recently bought these Adidas men's wrestling shoes for my son, and we're extremely impressed! The shoes offer excellent grip and support, allowing my son to move confidently on the mat. The quality is outstanding, and they fit true to size. Plus, the stylish design is a bonus. These shoes have definitely enhanced my son's performance and confidence during matches. Highly recommend for any young wrestler!"
Adidas,2024-02-12,Very comfortable shoes. fit my legs well. I payd for fast delivery and they arrived really fast
Adidas,2024-03-01,My daughter does boxing for sport and she loves ❤️ this pair Adidas wrestling shoes she says are really light and really comfortable
Adidas,2024-02-17,My son loved the pink.  True to size.
Adidas,2024-02-20,Bought for my husband and they are perfect. He’s an adidas guy and very particular about his sneakers.These are super nice!!! You won’t be disappointed.
Adidas,2024-02-26,Todo según lo publicado!
Adidas,2024-03-24,"First off, I want to start off with the positives. The shoe itself looks amazing and very sporty. The gray and silver colors offset by the neon orange sole and interior looks fantastic. As far as comfort goes, the generous sole thickness makes for pleasant walking, hiking, and even gym-use. My only complaint about the shoe is that the insoles themselves are lackluster and extremely disappointing. After having the shoe for simply two weeks and after doing some extensive walking, I noticed that the insoles were slowly running up the back of my feet due to slippage. In an attempt to be creative, I replaced the insoles with the same insoles I was using in the New Balance shoes these were intended to replace. I may have created a Frankenstein shoe in the process, but no one will know or be able to see the insole replacements. The end result is a fantastic shoe with an extremely comfortable insole that no longer moves."
Adidas,2023-12-10,"Los tenis son muy bonitos, muy contento con la compra, llegaron muy rápidos, todo muy cumplido"
Adidas,2024-01-10,"Me preocupaba la talla pero me quedaron bien, ahora solo queda ver su durabilidad.ActualizacionEn el 1er día de uso  y en la parte interna se desprendió la almohadilla. A un mes de uso la suela en la parte trasera se despegó y se agujereo. Pésimo"
Adidas,2023-12-04,
Adidas,2023-11-11,First day of wearing them…. Very comfortable on the feet.
Adidas,2023-12-15,Los tennis tienen defectos y se observa la pega
Adidas,2024-03-25,"They fit great, look great, at a good price."
Adidas,2024-01-23,"I really like these shoes. They fit perfectly and are very comfortable. Also, I like that my feet don't get cold in low temps as I've had that problem with other shoes."
Adidas,2024-03-07,"The gray on the front of the shoe is more of an off-white grey. Not dark grey like in picture. Shoes are comfortable, light, and fit to size."
Adidas,2024-03-12,"My foot is shaped like the shoe box, size 12 fits my foot better than the 11 I measure. ""Pointer feet"" probably fit as sized.  Bought these to help rehab my new knee and really like them.  Tread is great on the sandy, rolling trails I prefer to walk; shoe is all day wear comfortable.  Toe bumper protects toes on trails and the forefoot is beefed up to prevent ""big toe poke through"". Wasn't sure about the color but it works in my ""casual dress code"" office."
Adidas,2024-03-18,Nice and reasonable price.
Adidas,2024-03-19,Love fit and feel
Adidas,2023-05-03,"I hike/walk these days. I had thought that I would stick with the Adidas AX style trail hiking shoes I've had, but I just returned a new pair of AX2s because the toe box on those are just too cramped.These trail runners are better up front and down below have a sole design that is more stable because they flare out, especially around the heel area.  I rolled my ankle more often on trails with the AX versions I've had.  The AX hiking shoes are also more jolting, while these are nice and cushy.The one downside, the soles rubber is soft and wears rather quickly if you have to run/walk some paved roads to get to the trail.  That said, the rest of the shoe is very durable.  My tread worn pair is still fine otherwise, even after many twig pokes and rock scrapes.Also, once the tread wears down, they are still fine for street use.  I'm saving my old pair for times when I will just be walking paved roads and don't need knobs."
Adidas,2023-10-27,"Update: After causing too much foot pain from using the trail running shoes running on trails, I've gone back to my old pair of proper trail runners. Even with a new insole these are not good trail runners for narrow D feet. Relegated now to yard work duties.----------These are supposed to be trail running shoes which should feature a snug heel and a roomy toe box. These are just your basic slightly wide regular fit.My foot is a narrow D so these are not super comfortable on the trail. If you are  a normal or wider D these should feel pretty good.The traction on rock and slippery surfaces, however, is outstanding.May see about getting a thicker insole and wearing some thicker socks to get me a snug fit. For the price (on sale) still good value if you are a normal or slightly wide D"
Adidas,2024-03-29,Fits perfect and size is as expected.  Easy to break in and very comfortable for a full 18. Highly recommend!
Adidas,2023-10-17,"Great shoe, comfortable, stylish and such a great price.  Can’t go wrong with these golf shoes"
Adidas,2024-03-31,Like the looks and tread pattern. I agree with other reviewers that they are lacking padding on the top ankle opening. Definitely need socks taller than the shoe.
Adidas,2024-04-01,"These shoes not only feel great but look great. Was not sure about spikeless golf shoes, but got to wear these on the course and it’s just what I was looking for. There styling too."
Adidas,2023-09-17,"Super light, flexible, water proof. Just like my daily runners. These run 1/2 size small. Normally I wear 9.5 Adidas, exchanged for 10. Perfect. First day out, all day 18 holes, no problem. Easy on and off. Super cushy heal pocket, outta bounce I in your step, no slipping. Love 'em."
Adidas,2023-11-14,"Bought these for my husband, who had lost his golf shoes.  Great value, great fit, great shoes!"
Adidas,2024-01-15,The product delivered was exactly what I was expecting. Good price great quality.
Adidas,2024-03-07,These will run on the front of your lower ankle. Tall socks recommended
Adidas,2024-04-08,"Super comfy, almost sock-like. I read reviews that said people couldn’t get their feet into them, but I had no issue. Definitely would buy again"
Adidas,2024-04-07,"Great fit, comfortable and stylish. Love them!"
Adidas,2023-10-31,"Fit is a bit tight initially but that is expected from a fabric - if you have super wide front of foot or fat feet they may not work.  My son has normal width feet, kind of a high arch. They fit great - and bonus for any young man they add about 13/4 in height (not me judging, just know guys like height)"
Adidas,2024-03-16,They fit perfectly
Adidas,2024-04-15,I love adidas anything. Coolest part of these bad boys is they are obviously solid red. That's why I bought em. I love the look. They are comfy and fit well. If you are a show person like I am then owning a solid red pair anybrand is a must. Buy and enjoy. You will.
Adidas,2024-04-11,"10/10 recommend! Adidas always delivers. It's about quality, supporting their mission, vision and purpose and can we just admire the vibrancy of these shooes???"
Adidas,2023-10-03,"I found the fit significantly tighter than my other shoes of the same size plus I am 83 years old and putting them on when there is a continuous piece of the shoe fabric where there usually is a tongue makes it really difficult for me, particularly my left foot which is slightly swelled sometimes. Not being able to spread the lacing area of the shoes when putting on the shoe has made it just too difficult for me to do even with long shoehorns. Because they are tight (even though all my good fitting shoes are the same US size as these so they should fit well) walking in them is not pleasant. Also, after wearing them with their very thick sole in the back, I have to assume that they were not made for men but really were made for ladies used to walking in high heels. I am giving them away and definitely will not purchase this style of shoe again."
Adidas,2024-03-08,"The shoes look excellent. I ordered 5 pairs total attempting to find the correct size for myself and my son. Turns out the issue isn't the shoe size. It's the opening you put your foot in. It is massively undersized, and since it isn't a typical tongue style shoe it can't be loosened or adjusted. I'm not skinny, but my son is. Neither of us could find a comfortable size"
Adidas,2023-07-31,"I wanted some non expensive spike-less golf shoes that still looked good. I’ve always been a fan of adidas so these looked great! Playing 5 rounds with them so far has been great! Being that they’re spike less, they don’t have outstanding grip in rain/mud. However, they do wash off and clean up really nice. They’re also durable enough to wear to the course and walk around on concrete. They’re stylish enough to wear out if you go to Topgolf or something that. My only complaint is they’re a little warm for Texas 115 degree weather, but that doesn’t even take it down from 5 stars."
Adidas,2023-12-26,These are the most comfortable golf shoes I have ever owned. they feel like your wearing slippers. I highly recommend them.
Adidas,2023-07-06,I bought these shoes for a trip to Europe. They survived 10+ daily mile walks. My feet didn’t hurt at the end of the day either. Needless to say they are broken in.
Adidas,2023-08-03,"Read the fine print, this is not a sneaker."
Adidas,2023-11-29,got a great deal on BF. The price went up afterward. Glad that I bought one.
Adidas,2023-12-21,"These shoes are really comfortable and great for a range session or a day on the course. However, the grass must be dry. If you are playing in the early morning or with some rain, the grip on these soles will not do the job so stick to spikes if you deal with a lot of rain or like to play early in the morning. Otherwise these shoes are amazing. Good casual spikeless shoe that is arguably more comfortable than any other shoe I own."
Adidas,2023-06-22,Great shoe by far my favorite golf shoe yet
Adidas,2023-08-26,"These are comfortable and really nice looking. They are easy to clean and the quality is great, hard to be Adidas!"
Adidas,2024-04-02,The shoes are very comfortable
Adidas,2023-09-04,"Bought these to replace my old Adidas that I’ve worn for about 12-14 years after the sole came off.  These are almost identical, lightweight, great grip during swings, and extremely comfortable.  Size is perfect."
Adidas,2024-03-31,Getting harder to find golf shoes with changeable cleats! Well worth the money!
Adidas,2023-12-09,The shoe looks and performs fine but the materials are a little cheap and they crease where the toe bends in a very stiff and uncomfortable way that does not yet seem to be breaking in. So far I'm happy with them as other than that they are comfortable and they look good for the money but if they don't soften up in the crease they will continue to be very uncomfortable.
Adidas,2024-02-02,"Size was perfect, fast delivery (even for Puerto Rico). Great shoes for the price."
Adidas,2023-12-30,Absolutely amazing with a great grip in both dry and wet weather!!
Adidas,2024-01-24,"I have a very old set of Adidas Tech golf shoes and got these as a backup after regluing the sole of my older set.The fit is similar, but the materials feel cheaper. The best way I can describe it is that it feels like a cheap set of fake leather shoes - but not the whole shoe, just parts of it. Time will tell how it holds up, but my initial impressions are not great."
Adidas,2023-11-29,These are extremely comfortable on my high school golfer who walks 18 holes and Carrie’s his bag. They are sturdy and keep his feet dry in the morning dew.
Adidas,2023-12-15,This shoe design is great. The shoes fit my wide feet well. The shoe is light. I wear this shoe at work in an office clinic setting and it is comfortable on my feet all day long. Only gripe is that the shoe insole that it comes with wears out rather quickly.
Adidas,2024-03-31,nice
Adidas,2024-03-20,"I got this sneakers and few, also Adidas, similar stile and design.  This sneakers are super light, have no shoelaces and on gray color is hard to see dust or dirt. Only one problem is insoles,  they don't last too long, but you can get them for cheap on internet and they will be good quality.."
Adidas,2024-04-15,"These are wonderful if you plan on using them indoors for a few months and then replacing them again. They're like wearing comfortable socks. They're very nice and lightweight, but the issue lies within the bottoms of these shoes.. the traction.. It's already pretty thin so it won't take much to turn these into slippers. I really enjoy how stylish these are and how easy they are to use as walking shoes, but this one detail really hurts their credibility in my opinion. If it wasn't for all the positives, I'd drop it down further on my rating. During the few months that these shoes are in great condition, you will absolutely love them."
Adidas,2024-03-08,Son lives in these. Easy slip on and off with no wear to the back.
Adidas,2024-03-17,"As a mostly remote (at home) worker these are my new go-to 'office' shoes. They are very comfortable and can wear all day without issues. I haven't tried exercising in these shoes. Not sure if the tops, without laces, would be supportive enough."
Adidas,2024-01-08,"My husband and I are both amputees (my left leg, his right). We struggle big time with shoes, we have found that this shoe is easy to get on and off with the least amount of effort. Definitely a good purchase for us. The only con I have with this product is that there isn't a style available similar to this that is waterproof. If I could change anything about the shoe it would be just to make it hold up to the elements a bit better. we wear through them rather quickly because the material isn't as durable as it should be, in my opinion."
Adidas,2024-02-28,"Slip on running shoe.  I know that they should stay on, but they are very snug. Pulls your sock up when trying to get then on.  Once situated,  these shoes are very comfortable and light."
Adidas,2024-01-09,"These golf shoes are comfortable and provide good support.  They look like tennis shoes - as opposed to golf shoes. I did go up a half a size, and the fit is perfect.  The spikes are pretty large, and I feel like they kind of leave marks on the greens. I walk very carefully."
Adidas,2023-11-14,"These golf shoes are perfect!  They fit perfectly, I could walk all day in them as they are so very comfortable!  I will definitely purchase them again!"
Adidas,2023-10-02,"I'm newer to the sport of golf and needed a shoe to get me started. These shoes are very comfortable and have a great material to keep your feet dry! For the price, this is a great shoe to start with."
Adidas,2023-10-29,"Felt stiff but based on other reviews, it needs to be broken into. I haven't use this item on the golf course yet so I cannot say anything else about it."
Adidas,2024-01-09,toe is a bit narrow. - nice shoe!
Adidas,2024-03-31,I absolutely love these and they have became my favorite. I always order a half size larger in any golf shoe and these were no different. They are perfect.
Adidas,2023-11-27,I wore these new out of the box thus past weekend at Talamore Golf Resort. Golfed 3 days straight and these were the most comfortable golf shoes ever!  I would recommend anyone purchasing them. They were true to size.
Adidas,2023-08-30,Bought to have an extra pair of golf shoes. When I purchased them thinking they were not waterproof. Wore them last evening for league play thinking it wouldn't rain. WRONG! Downpour for 15 minutes. These shoes were WATERPROOF.  My feet were dry by the time I got to the clubhouse. Wonderful golf shoes for rain. Very comfortable. The size fit perfectly without getting a 7.5. wide.
Adidas,2024-01-08,"I've always been a fan of Adidas and the reason is they make comfortable quality shows at a great price. These are stylish, with god comfort, and a unique design.  I wasn't disappointed and they came in great condition and delivery was as expected. I can tell you how nice these shoes look and I've got my wardrobe in place already. What I like about these is that they're easy to slip on and off, they're, light weight, and they are a good fit. They have a nice hug around the ankle and they are true size so stick with my normal size and I have about 1/2"" cushion which gives me great comfort. You don't have to worry about the shoe coming off as it fits like a glove, so you can run, jump, or workout in these with no issues. The best thing about these shoes is the style, and then in a strong 2nd is the comfort. I own multiple pair of Adidas and these are just as comfortable as my older ones with a nice look. I don't have a call out for anything I didn't like I love Adidas and that's a fact."
Adidas,2024-03-24,Easy to put on. No laces to tie. Minimalistic simple design. Ordered the size 7.5 and it's true to size. Very comfy.
Adidas,2024-03-10,My original ultra boost got worn out for the years I had worn it. These fit true and is comfortable for a long period of time. As well as a great gym shoes
Adidas,2023-12-28,These are comfortable and great looking shoes.The slip on feature is nice and they feel tight on the foot once put on.I will advise to get at least a 1/2 size larger than a normal shoe. If the shoes are too tight in the toe you will see the outlines of your toes. It is not the best look!
Adidas,2023-12-10,"Very comfortable for everyday use, running, sports or gym use. They might have a tighter foot entrance than you're use to (if you haven't worn similar ones before) but not to worry, it's just tighter to make sure they stay on your feet. I have been buying this style of shoe from adidas for a few years now and I've been loving them. Very durable shoe as well. I've been using one of the pairs for 3 years as a work shoe (it's not one but I use it as one) and the shoe is in great condition considering it's a more labor intensive job and always on my feet. So I'd say these will last you a good amount of time and while having a good look and feel."
Adidas,2024-04-04,love the shoe very comfortable and extremely light weight
Adidas,2024-03-28,Wear these as my house shoes. Easy slip on. Very comfy. They are great.
Adidas,2024-03-28,My grandson loves them n says they are very comfortable
Adidas,2023-09-21,"After being in use of these for a couple months, these quickly became my favorite shoes in general above others! ADIDAS has always been my go-to shoes for just fashion and basic comfort, Forums in all forms are my personal favorite, and then I got these Grand Court 2s for long standing at work. All-in-all, I can best express my feelings to these as stylish, comfortable, and quite durable in the long run because they look great in basic all black and are the easiest to clean and shine after work. I often use these when I'm out shopping and visiting friends as well, I'm just that confident in these as comfort shoes and I have some decently wide feet as well. Since I have them in all black, the creases don't really show up when you are not actively looking for them, which is a plus and to add to that, it barely creases when casually walking. I was also told to size up by another half for better fitting, which I did, and I can still feel a bit of extra toe room as I slide my feet in.At the end of the day, it's definitely my favorite everyday shoes when I'm not over thinking about style and comfort. It's so good I would actually recommend this at base price, but I did catch these shoes at 30% lower so if it goes on sale, I wouldn't hesitate at the thought of buying these."
Adidas,2024-01-09,"I bought this court shoe for my husband to play pickleball on outdoor courts, and he likes it.  I would say it's true to size because he told my what size shoe he wears, I ordered that size, and he said it fits fine, no problems.  His feet are average width.  I call them his ""Run DMC"" shoes because it reminds me of the style of shoes Run DMC wore on MTV.  I can tell he loves the shoes because he is careful not to get them dirty and cleans them after every use.  He does not do that as much with his other athletic shoes.  He speculated that the shoes MAY have had some kind of slippery-type ""finish"" on the bottom of the shoes, because the first time he wore them, he slid on the court several times and actually fell, BUT the court may have had light/not visible moss on it from a prior rain.  He is very athletic so he didn't fall because he's old or out of shape.  Since that first time using the shoes about a month and a half ago, he hasn't slid or fallen since.  I knocked off a star for ""value for money"" because supposedly it was a deal at just under $63 but after that, about a month later, the price dropped to under $45.  I hate when that happens, ugh!  Anyway, I hope you found this review helpful because it's hard to buy shoes online since you can't try them on first."
Adidas,2024-04-14,I love my adidas Grand Court 2.0. I usually go with the Adidas Superstars but these are just as good withsome minor design differences. I did have to got up a a full size as they were a tighter fit than the Adidas Superstars. They are comfortable to wear and go with any outfit.
Adidas,2024-02-23,I tried the Air Force Ones but didn’t love the fit and they were difficult to walk in. These are a GREAT option for a similar look! Very comfortable to walk in and they fit perfectly to size.
Adidas,2023-08-02,"I love the look, the fit, and the comfort of Adidas shoes. These are attractive shoes, solid, white, with the three burgundy stripes. The only complaint that I have is that they arrived in a white bag with the shoebox inside. The shoebox was completely crushed and mangled. Not so much a problem for me, because it was going in the trash, but for some shoe collectors, the box is just as important as what’s inside."
Adidas,2024-04-07,Great product. I use them for work
Adidas,2024-04-02,Fit perfect great for anyone that wants a comfy cheap durable shoe
Adidas,2024-02-23,"Just what I expect from Adidas... A too quality shoe full of comfort and awesome looks. I have several pairs of Superstars and while I love them, especially for the old school look, these are definitely MUCH more comfortable. I mean, the in-sole is fantastic! Gel and crazy comfortable. I'll definitely be buying more"
Adidas,2024-02-29,"Just got these back after a year hiatus. Perfect shoes for basic, neutral stylin' around town. Pretty much will go well with anything your wearing. The soles are white and will last forever and don't scuff: they wear evenly well. I paid like $10 more at Shoe Carnival 3 years ago, so these are a steal and the price is still going down a week later. BUY these. They look good for at the beach, bar, work/office, airport.. I'm probably end up buying another pair for strictly inside around the house to keep the carpets clean, and one for nights on the town as these have been my everyday walking shoes. Downside is, the whitewalls of the soles of the shoes will show ANYTHING that get up there, so I'll wipe them with a Mr. Clean magic eraser once a week to keep them fresh looking (also, being former army, I know ""if you take care of your gear, your gear will take care of you"" 😋); also another reason I'm buying a pair for around the house, etc. Get them now, they are an investment and will last year's if you keep them clean. Will shrink slightly if you machine wash them. Air-dry with hairdryer or in the direst sun"
Adidas,2024-02-27,"I love these shoes. I thought I’d have to break these shoes in, but they fit perfectly and comfortably immediately. I typically wear a size 11, which is the size I purchased, and they were true to fit. These have a classic style that I can wear as everyday shoes. I’d absolutely buy another pair."
Adidas,2024-03-30,"They look nice and fit comfortably, perfect casual walking shoe."
Adidas,2024-03-03,"The insoles that come with these are barely thicker than construction paper, and offer zero support. Add your choice of quality insoles and you'll have a 5 star pair of shoes. This is the first time I have ever been disappointed in an Adidas product; I remedied the situation but wish I hadn't had to spend the extra money."
Adidas,2024-04-15,"I'm a teacher, so I'm on my feet a decent amount of the day and, so far, these shoes have been amazing. Incredibly comfortable with an almost molded soul, great tread, and stylish looking. I often get compliments from my colleagues and students (who can be very picky with what they like) on my shoes. These are my go to shoes for work or everyday now. Also a plus that it is a well known name like Adidas who has been making quality products for years and years now."
Adidas,2024-03-09,Fits true to size and don’t even have to break the shoe in. Great classic Adidas look. Completely satisfied with the shoes.
Adidas,2024-04-14,"I adore these shoes. For the price, they’re very comfortable and I love the way they look."
Adidas,2024-02-28,"I've been looking for something of a modern style mixed with a classic feel - this shoe is definitely it. It's comfortable, stylish, and i didn't break the bank buying a $100+ shoe. The shoe fits true to size in my experience and i have a wider foot. Would highly recommend!"
Adidas,2024-04-09,These were on sale so I thought to give them a try. Very light weight and comfortable. Had good ground contact and stability. Amazon recommended a half size larger which I did and they fit perfectly. I’m normally a 10.5 in men’s boots and shoes but 11 are just right. These have a really nice look and descent quality
Adidas,2024-03-03,"Love everything about these shoes.Best shoes I have ever owned.Lightweight, comfortable, functional and best of all a great price!"
Adidas,2024-03-19,"This was the first time I had bought this brand of golf shoes. They are very comfortable, and appear to be of very good quality. If I had a complaint, it would be that the soles retain too much dirt and are a little difficult to clean."
Adidas,2024-04-12,"I want to give these shoes a high rating but there is one downside to buying white, mesh shoes. In wet grass of a golf course, they will stain. I've not tried to wash them yet but I can easily see the sort of orange line about halfway up the front of the shoe caused by walking in tall grass (yes, I mean in the tall grass away from the fairway...where I frequently end up).Other than that, they are really good shoes. The gripping base holds the grass well even if it picks up and holds goose droppings and mowed grass.Very comfortable, good fit and very sturdy. I bought a size 14 and it's just right for my size 13 (or so) feet.I don't really pay  much attention to the staining as they're golf shoes and everyone's golf shoes show use.Good product."
Adidas,2024-03-18,"I haven’t yet had the chance to play a film round in them. However, for the price these are insanely comfortable and lightweight and the grip is phenomenal."
Adidas,2024-04-14,Very comfortable and looks great! Awesome price for the value!
Adidas,2024-04-11,"Feel great and have awesome grip on the course! I have a wider foot, and they fit just fine."
Adidas,2024-03-26,Fits true to size. Very comfortable shoe. Good value.
Adidas,2023-10-17,I love the style and fit of the shoe. Everything about them is great except that the insole of the shoe has worn down significantly in the heel and toes. All the way down to the fabric underneath. Other than that the shoes are great.
Adidas,2024-02-04,"Very comfortable. I normally order an 8 in sneakers, but it was unavailable in this color/style, so I opted to try the 7.5. It’s VERY wide around the heel, but the length is perfect. I’m returning them, but if the heel was more narrow, they’d definitely be keepers!!!"
Adidas,2023-01-29,"I love them,but they run too big. I usually wear an 8,but as I read in the reviews they run large I ordered a71/2,but they still big so I reordered a 7 and finally fit,so my advise is to get a number down"
Adidas,2024-03-23,"I’m absolutely in love with these sneakers !I’m wear them often and stay on top of keeping them clean & white.*Tip: Add a tiny bit of water slowly into a paste mixed with Dawn soap, baking soda, oxy clean and/or hydrogen peroxide. Brush on to clean, let air dry ir rinse and let air dry. Can also use a magic eraser on the soles but brushing works great"
Adidas,2023-08-21,"They are very nice, but they are not shoes to wear all day they have no arch support they are very stiff and the tongue doesn't stay flat you have to really pull and tug to be able to get them tied them. They are not for the ladies maybe for young kids . I bought them to replace an old adidas pair and they are not made the same anymore."
Adidas,2024-03-24,"Bought these for the color, style, and manufacturer. They're fine if you don't have to walk on rocks. The soles look thick but you can feel rocks thru the soles."
Adidas,2023-08-18,"Second pair because I love the first pair.  I need a wide toe box with thinner heal, and some arch support in a decent looking shoe.  These fit me so well.  Have tried 7 or 8 different styles this year and none of them fit me well or were cheaply made.  These shoes are very well made, good support with just the right outer sole thickness.  These are 9.5, I wear a 10 in other Adidas shoes.  I am an adidas fan but not impressed with this year's products, except these.  Size down a half size."
Adidas,2024-02-28,Ok so they are white ... I've prepared them with protectant and they are white sneakers. They seem to be true to size ... As they should be. They came on time ... Had to return a larger pair to then get a new pair but that went smoothly.Enjoy!  ~(*¿*)~
Adidas,2023-05-18,"Great shoe - not sure if I would label this a running shoe...maybe a walking shoe.  Casual.  I normally fit 10.5 and needed to get an 11, but worth the price."
Adidas,2023-03-11,A bit narrow but overall fantastic shoe.
Adidas,2023-06-24,"I got a pair of Adidas Nizza shoes for the same price that were very similar to these...at least it seemed. I just wanted a simple pair of white slip on shoes for sunny summer days. They are white, and slip on, but it gets pretty disappointing after that.The band on the side that is supposed to flex is more of a visual gimmick, which makes walking uncomfortable when it's combined with the shoe's unusual tight width.On the bright side- they'll stay clean for longer because I'll barely wear them. Realistically- I wish I had spent $10 more and gotten basic white shoes that I can wear without pain."
Adidas,2023-08-06,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Decently budget skate shoes which it was made for, elastic band pretty tight but in a skate sesh is manageable. Insole sucks. But the sole of shoe also grips to the board well which is what i want. Not made for walking shoes, get a pair of comfortable running shoes instead of these skate shoes."
Adidas,2024-04-15,I love the shoes. Great fit and great brand. So worth the money
Adidas,2023-08-02,"I have narrow feet and heels usually have problems with shoes coming loose at the heel and ankle area. I purchased these based on some of the reviews that stated that these shoes ran small/narrow. The problem is that the elastic appearing band at the arch of the shoe is actually not elastic and appears to be more of a cosmetic touch. Even with my narrow feet, I had problems getting my foot into the shoe without a fair amount of effort assisted by a shoe horn. The band is relatively rigid and places a great deal of constriction in the midfoot area and along the inner arch of the foot. Once my foot is in the shoe, this constriction is very obvious and yet the heel/ankle area remain loose. This is a very non-anatomically sized shoe. The length appears to be true to fit, its just this midfoot band that is extremely uncomfortable. Also, the sole of this shoe is very stiff. It is not at all flexible unlike what you would normally expect in a casual slip on shoe. I was very disappointed as I liked the cosmetics of the shoe. Unfortunately, I have to say that this is one of the most uncomfortable shoes that I have ever purchased. I should have heeded the negative reviews that talked about how uncomfortable these shoes are. I just thought that it was because people had purchased the wrong size shoe. However, it is the construction and design of the shoe that makes it ill-fitting and uncomfortable. Perhaps that is why they are discounted so much. I have owned several pair of Adidas shoes (in the past they tended to fit well as they tended to accommodate narrower feet like mine). However, this is the first Adidas shoe style that I could not wear (in the proper 8.5 size) due to extreme discomfort. Again, quit a disappointment as I thought that I could snag a “deal” as I really liked the sleek and clean look of the shoe. Will definitely be returning after just trying them on for 3-5 minutes."
Adidas,2023-04-30,These are comfortable but after a few months the insoles are deteriorating. It’s really weird. I’ve never seen a pair of shoes disintegrate like this.
Adidas,2024-03-29,Me gusto mucho por su comodidad
Adidas,2024-04-05,"I did like the comfort and protection for my feet, only draw back my shoe laces broke first time putting them on to tie the shoes. But replaced with white which all I had  but did work for the shoe. Less tired feet have noticed."
Adidas,2024-04-15,Fit was great and are holding together pretty good so farWas concerned about cloth but camp dry to be 100% every now and then and material is holding up better than expected
Adidas,2024-01-31,"They're great shoes, but I'm usually an 11.5 this shoe definitely runs small. Should have bought the size 12. Interesting has I have other Terrex products and fit fine as an 11.5."
Adidas,2023-12-13,"Adidas are the only brand I buy online because I know I won't have any fit problems. I wear a normal Size 10 and these fit as expected. They look cool and they are comfortable. Great traction and no issues so far. I will update this review should I have any issues when I put miles on these.Update 1: This is my second pair of Adidas Terrex shoes. My other pair are Terrex Skychaser LT GTXs. These AX4 are a little bit different. The toe box is a little bit more narrow. Not a problem for me, but keep this in mind if you have wide feet. Also, the sole and heel of the AX4 is much more firm. These are not squishy when you walk or run, but the sole is very supportive."
Adidas,2024-04-02,Great hiking shoe ! Has wonderful traction. Very comfortable and durable shoe
Adidas,2024-03-23,These shoes run small compared to other adidas. I’m typically a 9 men’s which translates to a 10 or 10.5 women’s and these fit super small my feet were hitting the front of the shoe. The shoe has a cool appearance but sadly don’t fit true to size.
Adidas,2024-04-13,Good for walking and running
Adidas,2024-03-17,This is a fair hiking shoe for the price I paid. It's a little snug but got more comfortable as I stretched them out. The black part of the heel has random white specks on them for some reason. For $59.00 it's a fair deal.
Adidas,2024-02-24,Love the ultra boosts. They hold up well. Super comfortable. Slide on and off and hug the feet. Use at the gym and for casual. Old pairs for hiking. Went with a little more color this time. Glad I did. I am typically between an 11.5 and 12. They fit true but the 12 is better for me. 11.5 definitely too snug.
Adidas,2024-03-11,"SOn loved them, comfortable, fast shipping."
Adidas,2024-02-27,would just like there to be a strap that makes them easier to put on like with the Yeezys.
Adidas,2023-11-12,"The shoes get more comfortable as you work them in, however they fit a bit tight around the toes."
Adidas,2023-11-20,"Perfect for running on dry roads.The shoe is a little narrow and squeezes a bit so it’s not the best for regular use.This is my second pair, they are well made and pretty durable if you are using them for it’s intended purpose. Ive used my first pair for 3 years and it’s still holding up.Great looking shoes and color way."
Adidas,2024-02-27,Extremely comfortable. Highly recommend.
Adidas,2024-04-01,Sneakers were already used and then terrible attempt to clean these garbage sneakers
Adidas,2024-02-25,Great shoes. My son wears them everyday
Adidas,2024-03-04,"I bought these because I am a huge fan of the old school Adidas. Not a fan of the new style logo !!! These were as close to old school as possible. Only thing that would have made them better would be the old school original logo on them.  Highly recommend these . Very comfortable, love the look ,fit and the price wasn't bad at all"
Adidas,2024-04-10,"Love, love, love these shoes!!  I was so surprised to feel how comfy these shoes are!  Very cute for that relaxed look!"
Adidas,2024-03-17,Love these shoes! Fit is good and they are super cute!
Adidas,2024-04-10,Love these sneakers
Adidas,2024-04-09,Took awhile to receive but perfect condition
Adidas,2024-03-12,Good fit
Adidas,2024-04-05,I bought these for myself. They are incredibly comfortable. They go with everything. My daughter ended up stealing them so I had to buy a second pair. They are an amazing value.
Adidas,2024-03-28,"Loved this look of these but I ended up returning because they weren’t the right size for me. I needed a wider, larger size. I think these were marked as men’s when I bought them, but they felt like a women’s size."
Adidas,2024-04-07,"These are definitely good running shoes that are very comfortable and well made o durable material. Also very reasonable on the value. I think they run a little small, but overall they are very good shoes."
Adidas,2024-04-10,These shoes look and feel great. Very light and comfortable. True to size.  Fit perfectly.  Will definitely buy these again.
Adidas,2024-03-08,"These are essentially a slip-on shoe, that tighten with the laces.  If you do not have a slim foot, getting yours into the shoe might not be very fun.  Luckily, there are large loops on the heel and what I would call the tongue.  These secure loops allow you to insert something that you can then pull up on.  For instance, I put a large screwdriver through one and a spoon handle in the other so I could pull up on the heel as well as the tongue to wrestle my foot into the shoe.  Once I finally got my foot into the shoe, it felt normal.  It did not feel too tight or uncomfortable.I have now worn the shoe for 72 hours straight as I can not remove it.  Just kidding, I was finally able to get it off with the help of my wife pulling on it like a tight boot.If you have ""chubby"" feet or just feet that are a little thicker than others, I would avoid this shoe at all costs.  Hope this helps you!Cheers!"
Adidas,2024-03-19,My son loves these.  They don't last super long - but that's to be expected; they're lightweight and mesh-like.  They take a beating pretty quickly.  But they look great and they're super comfortable.
Adidas,2024-03-04,"Do yourself a favor. If you have wide feet like I do, you’re going to love these trainers. They fit comfortably from day one. No painful breaking in. No tight ( or hot ) spots. As a bonus they look amazing."
Adidas,2024-03-19,Overall the shoes are great! Little tight on the tongue part only cause it’s not a tongue haha. Would buy again! Green ones look the best!
Adidas,2024-04-10,"I bought these exclusively for the gym based on another review.  They have a firm sole / feel that's good for weight-lifting stability, but they're also comfortable enough for the treadmill or biking.  I don't think I would try to run for any real distance in these though.....JMO."
Adidas,2024-03-19,"These are the brightest white, most stylish, most comfortable goes with every casual outfit shoe I’ve ever owned. Of course it was made by my fav brand. Absolutely love the logo design for the shoe. I will say this is absolutely a shoe that should be sprayed with waterproof spray multiple times before wearing."
Adidas,2023-11-08,"I went back and forth on these for a while before deciding to finally buy them. So glad I did! They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn! These shoes wear all day on the course and then to run some quick errands perfectly! No breaking in needed! I wish I had just bought them earlier! They don’t get dirty, they are super comfortable and look great with every outfit! Would highly recommend to anyone on the fence about them. Also, bought my true size and they fit perfect!"
Adidas,2024-01-15,"Love it, very comfortable walking around. Not to mention Cute!!! Pink is more peachy than picture."
Adidas,2023-10-15,Super comfy fit and very clean looking golf sneakers! Not heavy so you can wear them when you walk the course! Easy to clean waterproof! Works great on the course.
Adidas,2023-06-17,I just started golf and wanted a basic golf shoe. I think these are perfect for beginners! They are cute and comfortable. I will say I wish I would have sized down half. I am usually an 8.5 but they are a little loose in the toe and around the ankle.
Adidas,2024-03-05,This is such a good looking golf shoe. It also looks really good off the course.
Adidas,2023-10-07,Super comfy and perdition fit! Love that they can be worn off the course as well.
Adidas,2023-09-09,"Perfect fit, love these shoes"
Adidas,2023-08-16,Great shoes and comfortable! Even for walking the course these were great!
Adidas,2024-04-09,"Great casual adidas shoes. Very comfortable with good cushion and support. I got them on sale for $45 which is a great price for these shoes……frankly what they should have cost considering they’re normally $75! I’m a man and the 9 1/2 fit true to size. I read some reviews saying they were fake or sized wrong, didn’t have problems with the quality or size. Highly recommend."
Adidas,2024-04-09,"I typically wear New Balance cross-training style shoe. I wanted a pair of navy blue suede Converse one stars. I couldn’t find what I was looking for. I bought these and similar style New Balance suede shoes. The New Balance didn’t fit as well as these, so I returned them. These are very comfortable and they look great. Too bad they didn’t have a navy blue suede available."
Adidas,2024-03-28,"Great shoes, right size as described"
Adidas,2024-03-12,"These Adidas VL Court sneakers are satisfying to me. They have a nice, smooth, sleek, and minimalist profile that i admire. I don't like to be too showy with my shoes, and these fit that bill.  They are relatively comfortable also. Their minimalist profile make them easy to use for driving small cars with tight footwells. I wish the uppers were real leather, however, I don't mind them being synthetic since i will use them for everyday use. Now, I can only hope that the uppers don't separate from the soles due to adhesive deterioration as several shoes have done in the past. At this point, i would recommend these shoes to all."
Adidas,2024-04-10,"I love these shoes and haven't stopped wearing them since I got them! They did chafe the back of my foot the first day, but nothing a couple of band-aids couldn't handle. Other than that, they have been very comfortable, and they were also really easy to clean after I got caught in the rain. I should get them in other colors!"
Adidas,2024-04-10,"All that snickers with front tip wrapping up and top made of fabric so borring and annoing. Leather and flat soul , forever!!"
Adidas,2024-01-02,Very nice and fit perfectly
Adidas,2024-04-11,"Fits me perfectly, color and style look great and love how vivid the green is."
Adidas,2024-04-09,We love these shoes. This is my daughters second pair because she grew out of the 1st ones. They are perfect for her feet and true to size. She can walk around all day in these and she never takes them off.
Adidas,2024-02-14,These Adidas are well made. My 8 year old wears them to school a couple days a week between these and her crocs. They still look new and easy to clean.
Adidas,2024-04-06,"ADIDAS toddler sneakers often run small and narrow, but this sneaker fit perfect on my toddlers wide foot.  No more tears while trying to but sneakers on!  Will be buying other styles!"
Adidas,2024-03-23,"These shoes were such a disappointment!!! My son used these for school only and within a week one of the Adidas straps were peeling off. I ended up just cutting it off. I should have returned them, but my son became attached to them and wanted to keep them. I definitely would not buy them again or recommend anyone else to buy them."
Adidas,2024-03-22,My grandson likes them and they look good on his feet and he says they are comfortable
Adidas,2024-02-09,My daughter loves these shoes and says they’re very comfortable. My only complaint would be the laces will not stay ties. They are fairly thick and even a double knot tends to come loose.
Adidas,2024-03-15,This is the 5th pair of this style shoe that I believe I have bought for my almost 5 year old since she’s started walking. Love them
Adidas,2024-03-20,"These are nice except one shoe came with the Velcro not stitched to the shoe so it wouldn’t stay on. An easy fix if you having a sewing kit handy, but just seems really sloppy overall."
Adidas,2023-07-31,"I have been looking for months for a solid white golf shoe, and I finally found the perfect pair!  I normally can wear a size 7.5 in men's shoes, and a size 8.5 in women's shoes.  I purchased these in size 8, and they fit perfectly.  They are listed in men's golf shoes, but they are the exact same shoe as the Adidas Zoysia women's golf shoe, you just need to order a half size down from your normal women's shoe size."
Adidas,2023-08-15,I'm not one of these husbands that plays golf to get away from my wife.  There's no one I enjoy being with more than the lovely missus and I actually have been trying to get her to learn to play golf so we can go to the top courses of the world while we're traveling.  She was hesitant at first but she signed off on the plan when I told her that it would require a brand new wardrobe.Her first requirement was 'cute shoes' which I amended to 'cute shoes that will be decent to play golf in'.  She made it clear that she didn't want anything that looked like the golf shoes at the thrift store which I think are the only ones she's ever seen.  No problem with that here--these are great looking adidas shoes featuring the retro 1990's pale yellow color that has been making a strong comeback.  She hasn't actually started to wear them golfing yet but she loves the way they look and how they fit.  She's a big fan of adidas products in general so they've single handedly made her excited about learning to play golf.  Good job!
Adidas,2023-08-01,"The shoes are remarkably well-constructed with no flaws visible on both the upper or lower.  The sole offers the spikeless full-grip pattern, and plenty of diamond-shape mini treads to hold you and your game securely to the ground.This shoe design has mesh over the toe box and near the end of the foot, and is not waterproof, but all other areas of the shoe appear to be waterproof, and easy to clean at the end of a round.  Overall, definitely the quality level one would expect from Adidas.Shipment arrived in a bag, never a good look for me when receiving a pair of pricey shoes where I might want to use the shoe box for storage.  Upon opening, the shoe box was completely smashed, so no storage box.  The shoes were well-protected and in great shape.  This item does not fall into the ""fast replacement"" category, only return and rebuy."
Adidas,2023-12-03,Toobig
Adidas,2023-09-03,I thought I was getting a white golf shoe with a touch of orange. There is way too much gold details for me. Other than the color these shoes are very comfortable. So I’m going to order the pure white version
Adidas,2023-08-25,Its a nice pair of shoes and they are true to size! Ho for it!
Adidas,2023-08-18,"So, the shoe itself looks really nice. It feels cushioned and comfy, and it seems like it would be a really great golf/walking/whatever shoe. Unfortunately I ended up with a UK 6.5 instead of a US 6.5 so they are too big, which is a bummer, because they’re very cute I a great color combo!"
Adidas,2023-08-15,"I have the pink version of these shoes and the shade of color is lighter than in the product photos. Quality and craftsmanship look great, but I ordered a 6 and received a 7 1/2. Also, different colors are more affordable than the pink version."
Adidas,2024-04-01,"My husband is pretty picky about sneakers and I wanted him to have some that are neutral to wear with multiple things and he really likes these! We didn’t get them for working out necessarily, just for when we do lots of walking while traveling. He wore them for the first time on our week long trip last month and we walked about 10k steps a day and he said they were extremely comfortable all week long!"
Adidas,2024-02-24,"This shoe feel great and is very stylish, the only CON not as much traction on the sole."
Adidas,2024-02-23,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Son muy cómodos y los uso para entrenar en la caminadora y no me sudan los pies. Ya compré los blancos también para variar el color."
Adidas,2024-02-08,"I prefer to purchase Adidas running shoes in part because they almost always fit me perfectly. These are no different. The fit is perfect and that makes them very comfortable when I run. Thus far, my only issue with the shoes are the tongues.  I need to adjust them before I tie my shoes. They will get bunched up if I don't do that. That is my only issue with the shoes."
Adidas,2024-02-07,these Adidas shoes are amazing. Feel comfortable A+ plus seller will continue to buy.
Adidas,2024-01-14,"My husband loves these shoes for walking. True to size, very comfortable and great price."
Adidas,2024-01-12,What can you say it’s an Adidas quality shoe all the way around
Adidas,2023-11-30,Perfect
Adidas,2024-04-16,Like walking on air!  Great value and look good.
Adidas,2024-03-20,"Supportive, good shoes. A little awkward to put on at first, but fit like a glove."
Adidas,2024-04-06,This is my third pair. Great for running and for casual wear.I usually wear 12 but 12.5 is better for me in this style.
Adidas,2024-02-29,"Bought for my 12 year old son who is disabled so he can't tie shoes was hoping these would be better but there very hard to get on because the ankle area is a Lil small, but besides that great shoes for the price"
Adidas,2024-04-11,"Fits true to size, its comfy, pretty basic shoe"
Adidas,2024-02-16,"Thanks to Travel and Leisure online magazine for recommending an Adidas running shoe - I couldn't find the specific one recommended and instead chose this Men's Lite Racer Adapt 5.0 Running Shoe: it did not disappoint! These are by far some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned: they are slip-ons, make excellent walking shoes, and are almost perfect for a treadmill run (""almost"" because they somewhat feel like slipping off but never actually do). In the many miles of walking or running on them, I have yet to have swollen feet (a little expected soreness maybe, but never swollen) and I almost do not notice having the shoes on. They are also very breathable. Finally, for the price I paid, they go from excellent to an outstanding value!"
Adidas,2024-03-02,"Excellent sneaker for the price. Easy slip on , no tie. Also comes in wide. Have wide feet abd Nike sneakers I always return. They seem to be be made for a 2 inch wide foot. Buying again. My go to sneakers from Adidas"
Adidas,2024-04-13,"These shoes are light and very comfortable in my opinion. Just slip them on and you’re in business. I wear them for everyday walks, hikes, and even at work."
Adidas,2024-04-13,"Overall, quite happy with these shoes. They are comfy, light and quite stable! Which is not the case with some of the recent Adidas running shoes - they have flip up outsole in heel area on the outside.These shoes are very good, was able to even hike in them on a muddy trail!  The only dis-advantage is that the material in the heel area started to peel off on  the inside post 1 year of wear."
Adidas,2024-04-05,"The quality is very good, light weight, and has good air flow. It has very good air flow that water will soak right thru. Not recommended to wear in rainy day."
Adidas,2024-02-29,They fit good and are comfortable.
Adidas,2024-03-22,Nothing to dislike. A wear a 11 & a half shoe size. Very comfortable and good looking shoes. Great value from a trusted shoe brand.
Adidas,2024-03-30,I bought 2 pair of shoes at the same time and find myself wearing these more.  I have a new everyday shoe with these.  Incredibly comfortable!
Adidas,2024-03-10,These fit my wide foot perfect. Very good walking shoe. Feet stay cool all day.
Adidas,2024-03-25,I really like these shoes. I'm a very active 287 lb man and cover a lot territory every day. These shoes have held up well and my feet dont hurt at the end of the day.
Adidas,2024-03-05,"So normally I don't post a review of shoes until they have to be replaced, that way I can comment on the longevity and such. But these shoes have inspired me, so to speak.I have been wearing them for a couple weeks, and they were very comfortable right off the bat, nice fit, good support, and all that. I wear my sneakers around work, as well as on my 2 mile walk on lunch break. So far, so good.But! Today I finally took my walk on wet ground and I am very disappointed with these shoes.It should be noted that:1. It was NOT raining although there was an on and off mist.2. I did NOT step in any puddles, or visible standing water, just wet ground.Still, I did not even get halfway through my two mile walk before my socks were noticeably WET. Just from whatever water my steps were throwing. No puddles, no nothing. My pant legs right above the shoes were barely affected. At the end of the entire walk, I can feel water squishing in my shoes.I don't know if it's because of the mesh material on top letting the water in, or what. What I do know is that the shoes I just got rid of, that had visible holes in the canvas after 2 years of daily wear, did not get my socks this wet.If you are planning to wear these shoes around the house, or work, or to the gym, they could be very comfortable, which is why the 3 stars. Maybe I am misusing these shoes for their original intent, but I kind of feel like ""shoes"" should be able to be worn ""outside"" at a minimum."
Skechers,2024-02-19,"These arrived in a very timely fashion. They were comfortable from the get go. My feet slid into them, hands free, with no trouble.  They're very attractive. They're machine washable! I'm totally pleased.  So much so that I  ordered a pair of Skechers hands free in black to wear during winter weather.  They arrived today.  They are very comfortable, good looking and my feet slid into them, hands free, with no problem. This pair, too, is machine washable."
Skechers,2024-03-24,"Just what I wanted! Fit is perfect, comfortable. I will be getting another or in different color!"
Skechers,2024-03-26,"Love that they are slip ons, look adorable with jeans!"
Skechers,2024-04-11,"I’m a size 6 in shoes. I got these in my normal size, and they feel tight. Not painful, but not comfortable at all. I love them though, so I guess I’ll be returning them for a 6.5"
Skechers,2024-03-21,These are wonderful just slip in and go. I look nice with blue jeans. They’re very comfortable. Just love them.
Skechers,2024-03-15,"I love this step-in feature.  It makes putting on shoes so easy.  I’ve purchased two pair for a granddaughter & one pair for myself.  The sizing is generous. So a half size down might be advised.  There is not much of an arch support, which is fine for me, but be warned.  I find them very comfortable & I’m happily wearing them every day."
Skechers,2024-03-08,"These shoes are the bomb!  Cute, comfortable and the fit was spot on!!  I love my new summer Skechers."
Skechers,2024-04-16,"Very strange-they slipped on easily, but literally pinched my small toes on both feet so badly my toes would go numb. They were cute, but not comfortable at all."
Skechers,2024-04-11,"Fits perfectly, very lightweight but sturdy and very comfortable"
Skechers,2024-04-09,They are so nice.  They fit my feet well and are so comfortable to walk in.  Easy to slip into.  Will be ordering not color in this style!
Skechers,2024-04-05,"I love everything about this shoe.  Comfy spongie insole, easy on, easy off.  I have had hip surgery and tying shoes or doing anything around my feet is difficult.  These shoes are making my life so much easier.  Attractive, light, cool, well padded.  Very happy feet!"
Skechers,2024-03-06,These shoes are very lightweight and comfortable. Nice material too.  I normally wear a wide shoe but these seem a bit loose and do not feel like a good sturdy shoe. Too much give for me.  So will be returning.
Skechers,2024-04-06,"These shoes are a perfect fit and are SO comfortable!  I appreciate this Seller offering shoes where we can choose the width size of the shoe.  Not many Sellers do this and I won't buy from any Seller who will not offer a width size.  The shoes are gorgeous, dark blue with white soles.  I love them and highly recommend this Seller."
Skechers,2024-03-28,I wear Sketcher brand walking shoes almost daily and find them to be very comfortable and supportive. These slip-ins are equally as comfortable and the price is better than I can find at our local outlet.  True to size.
Skechers,2024-04-11,I can't say enough about these comfortable shoes. I have neuropathy and it's hard for me to find a shoe that's comfortable. I looked high and low and finally ran across these and I read the reviews. They are so comfortable I could wear them all day. And they are pretty. This is navy blue I want to get a few more pair in different colors. In other tennis shoes like Nikes I wear a nine but in Skechers I wear my size 8 1/2. I actually ordered a 9 and a 8 1/2 just to make sure that one of them fit. The 8  1/2 fit perfect. They look so nice with my blue jeans I mainly wear them to doctor's appointments hair appointments stuff like that. I don't wear these for my long walking which you could but I need just a little bit more support in the ankle. I definitely give them five stars. And I highly recommend them.
Skechers,2024-04-15,"I bought these for an upcoming trip to London because of the number of positive reviews, and I wore them for about 2 weeks prior to our trip just to make sure they were what I wanted (I'm a school teacher and do a fair bit of walking everyday).  They're great!  Comfortable, easy to put on and take off, very little slippage, and very light weight.  Also, cute!!!  I was so excited, I bought two more pairs in other colors.Cue to our very recent trip to London.  7 days of sightseeing, using the tubes to get where we needed.  By Day 2, I had a tiny blister on the ball of my foot.  Figured it was because of increased walking, but okay.  By the end of Day 3, that blister was a bit larger and a new formed on the side of my heel.  By Day 4, I had a third blister on my other heel, and I was forced to drain the first blister because I could barely walk.  By Day 5, all the blisters were bigger (the one I had drained had developed new ones around it), I was trying to drain the remaining two.  By Day 6-7, the pain was near-unbearable.  I had been using blister patches for days, but still.  Things were made worse with our trip home when one of the patches slipped off and got wedged under my toes and rubbing that area raw.  Being in the airport and airplane, there was no real space for me to take off my shoes to air out my feet and blisters.  I got home last night, and the drained blisters had crusted over and refilled, one with blood.So while these shoes may be now a decent choice for light daily walking, I cannot recommend them for intense, vigorous walking."
Skechers,2024-02-19,"First off, my husband is a one pair of shoes at a time guy. He buys a pair and wears them to work, church, going out, you name it. Unless it calls for a winter boot or a dress shoe. He’s wearing a version of these sketchers. With daily use these hold up great! We get about 6 months out of each pair and simply order a new one. He started with the grey ones, then the beige, now the all black. We’ve liked all the colors, they all go well with a variety of his wardrobe. I’d say the grey are the most versatile.Hes on his feet all day and never complains of pain or discomfort with these. And I love that they can be easily slipped off when when he enters the house!The fit is standard and shipping is quick, through the different colors the sizes have been consistent as well!I see a lot of men in these and overall they look good and are really functional!Highly suggest!"
Skechers,2024-03-02,These were a great choice.  Normally I need to try on shoes in person but these were a great fit.  They are stylish and very comfortable.
Skechers,2024-04-02,"We own these shoes in multiple colors. They are great for anyone that is on their feet all the time. Lots of support, true to size, and stylish can we worn dressed up or just casually."
Skechers,2024-03-01,I have purchased this same pair three times over. They look good with almost any outfit and are extremely comfortable.My only gripe is I’ve had to purchase these multiple times because Skechers aren’t very durable. The insole falls apart after 6 months and the tread will go bald. I’ll still buy another pair after these fall apart.
Skechers,2024-02-15,"My son is 14 and is on the Autism spectrum, so he’s incredibly sensitive to shoes & clothing.  He normally only wears crocs shoes but needed a pair of runners for PE class & long distance walking.I love that these shoes are easy to slip on, have a wide option and are super comfortable for him. I literally ordered 6 different types of shoes for him to try on at home, as taking him shoe shopping can be difficult for him. I even ordered a more expensive brand (Kizik) and he ended up choosing these sneakers (half the price) as they were the best fitting for him.The quality and style is awesome, but the fit is hands downs what is the best thing about this style. It has a soft gel type insole that moulds to his foot and he’s able to wear these all day without complaining his feet hurt.If you’re on the fence about buying these, try them! Amazon has an amazing return policy which is why I love shopping here."
Skechers,2024-03-25,"Bought these for some comfortable shoes for throwing in cornhole tournaments. And these shoes are great, so lightweight and comfortable. I ended up getting 2 pairs of these. One pair is a half size over the first pair I got to accommodate a thicker sock if I want it. Love these and they really look good also."
Skechers,2024-04-02,"My husband loves his gray ""dress sneaker"" Skechers, but they're getting a bit worn. So I got him these and he opted for the tan to have something different. They are neat-looking and classy enough for work outfits and restaurants, but also comfortable and plain enough for casual settings. We love the versatility. They also earned a nod of approval and nice compliment from our teen, so apparently they pass as ""non-embarrassing"" as well."
Skechers,2024-02-21,"These are comfortable, light, and supportive, while still being attractive and not frumpy -- plus not expensive.  The holy grail of shoes.  I've bought several colors for my husband because he loves them and wears the heck out of them."
Skechers,2024-04-08,"Love! Roomy for a wide foot. I wear an 11.5 wide. I have walked in them for weeks, and they are comfortable, they breath and they look great. Highly recommend! Will purchase more colors for next fall season."
Skechers,2024-04-13,Very comfortable. Good looking. True to size. I'll be buying more!
Skechers,2024-02-28,The right shoe is too big for me?? but very cute. I might order a smaller size.
Skechers,2024-04-12,Sketchers don't disappoint...very comfortable and fit well...look nice too!
Skechers,2024-03-24,These shoes I bought because I love Sketchers shoes. So comfortable and these looked nice enough to wear to church.They had them in all different colors!No I didn’t go to the Mall to buy them! I ordered them from Amazon because I have ordered many pairs of shoes and really liked the fit! I have never sent any back that didn’t fit.I got a grease spot on the top and put them on a casual cycle on the washer and when they finished drying they looked brand new!Win Win!
Skechers,2024-04-07,Sketchers are my go to shoes. They always fit and last forever! Super comfy and podiatrist recommended years ago. I’ll buy again!!
Skechers,2024-01-10,"I normally wear 9 or 9.5 WW shoes,, which are very hard to find, and when located are expensive.  I was pleased when a friend told me that some women’s Skecher shoes come in wide width and would be wide enough to accommodate my WW foot.  So, I tried these and other Skecher styles.  Yes.  The wides can accommodate a WW foot.  But Skechers makes its wide shoes so wide that the heel slips whenever I walk and I can’t keep them on my feet.  I liked this shoe.  It didn’t have much arch support or cushion, but it was comfortable enough and dressy enough that it looked good with dress slacks.  I tried putting a forefoot cushion into the shoe to push my foot back into the heel.  Nope.  I tried putting a pad into the heel to better grip my foot.  Nope.  I tried both remedies.  Nope.  Couldn’t keep the backs from flipping up and down.  I’m desperate for attractive, comfortable WW or equivalent shoes that fit both the front and back of my foot.  These were returned."
Skechers,2024-03-14,"First pair of sketchers closed toe shoe. True to size though. They seemed a bit tight at first, I wear and 8 but because this shoe a crocheted fabric, I opted to keep them as I know they will stretch a bit. Overall, a great work shoe :) Very happy"
Skechers,2024-03-24,"I have been wearing these for years and they work well for a shop environment,  soft and flexible with good support,  I can't wear a steel toe or work boot type shoe for what I do and I  like these"
Skechers,2024-04-03,Fit as expected and look very good for work sneakers.  Comfortable.
Skechers,2024-01-16,Great shoes for restaurant work. Comfortable.  Not totally slip proof. Haven't slipped but have slid.
Skechers,2023-11-19,"Bought these a year ago they have held up well. Nice fit and comfortable, have walked a lot in these sneakers at work. Buying another pair since the sole bottoms are wearing a bit after a year of use. These are great sneakers for the price."
Skechers,2024-03-04,"For many years I have always purchased the Skechers Felton model...twice a year.  However, this time I couldn't find my size/wide width.  Also, the Felton model is no longer featured on the Skechers website.  I think the Dighton model is the new replacement...because as far as I can tell it is almost identical to the former Felton...just a slight cosmetic update.Update.  After wearing the Dighton for a week in the restaurant I realized that the ""toe box"" is wider.  It is definitely a more comfortable shoe than the Felton.  I think that's the only difference."
Skechers,2024-03-29,"I love these sketches they are good, reliable, work shoes at a great price recommend very highly"
Skechers,2024-01-27,Thought shoes would have lasted longer than 4 months. Bottom of soles held up but outside material on top and sides started peeling off.
Skechers,2024-03-26,"I found these shoes to be very comfortable. Walking constantly on my security patrols I need these comfortable, casual and slip resistant shoes."
Skechers,2023-11-06,I have been for wearing  lace up Skeechers for years but I have a physical problem trying to bend down and tie the laces. It was very difficult for me to put on my shoes. This has now changed. These are breeze to put on.It is as easy as the commercials say. No bending or pushing They are very comfortable and look good. Since I don't have to wear dress shoes any more I guess I have a new way of dressing.  I will probably order another pair in a different color. I highly recommend these.
Skechers,2023-12-31,"Great comfort, good instep cushioning and I have one foot with flat arch..  Slip on easy, size accurate.  Have purchased two pair..  look nice."
Skechers,2024-03-18,"My husband has hard to fit, wide feet.  These fit and were comfortable.  They looked really nice with his jeans.  Much dressier than his usual sneakers but with all of the comfort of sneaker."
Skechers,2024-04-12,"I am enjoying the easy slip on feature. No using a shoe horn anymore. They look great, too!"
Skechers,2024-01-27,"First got a pair of these loafers in my normal size, and Skechers is usually on the money, but this time they were not a good fit. More specifically, the right shoe was too big at the heel, so when I walked around my right heel would pop out. I double checked that both shoes were the same and expected size. Exchanged the pair for the next half size down, and now I have a better fit (although the right shoe is still slightly roomier at the heel than the left, but not enough to be a problem again).Other than the initial fitment problem, the shoes look good, are comfortable for wearing around the house on a daily basis, and, importantly, my feet don't get too hot in them.The full star off in the rating is due to the fitment issue and because of the high price. Not sure these are worth the $80 price tag, but they better at least last a good while."
Skechers,2024-04-11,"Shoe fits well, pleased."
Skechers,2024-02-09,"I bought these for my father, he is 87 and has swollen feet from medication.  He loves the fact he can just step right into them.  Says they are comfortable also.  May buy another pair in a different color."
Skechers,2024-02-23,Excellent shoes.  I had purchased the exact shoe before and they were great and easy to slip in and out. I did unfortunately select a wide size but should have stayed with the regular width. My fault. Sizes run true. Returned them but wouldn’t hesitate to purchase this shoe design in the future.
Skechers,2024-04-16,"These are comfortable, light weight walking shoes, I think a good buy for the money and true to size.  I am walking 2-3 miles a day and  they seem to be holding up well"
Skechers,2023-04-02,The only Shoes I wear.
Skechers,2024-03-23,These Skechers are just really comfortable and a perfect fit. I usually take a size10 in skechers sandals and shoes but find I need a size up for training shoes.  These ate fabulous walking shoes as they offer great support and cushioning for the feet ... I  recommend these trainers ... you won't be disappointed.
Skechers,2022-03-27,Just received these a few days ago. I have only worn them in the house so far due to recent rain.I ordered a half size up and they are really comfortable and lightweight. Traction on sole is also good. Ready to enjoy spring morning walks!
Skechers,2024-03-27,Sketchers never disappoints. Subtle style with a lot of comfort.
Skechers,2023-03-02,Extremely comfortable!
Skechers,2024-03-28,"These walking shoes are very comfortable, but I have to size up! I'm a true 7.5 with medium width feet and ordered these in 7.5 regular. Wearing exercise socks, my toes reached all the way to the end of the shoe and my pinky toes were slightly pressed in. There was no wiggle room at all.I'm going for size 8!"
Skechers,2020-09-23,"This is my second pair of Sketchers Go Walk and they are the most comfortable sneaker.  They are soft, have goodarch support and a solid gripping sole.  I walk 2-3 miles a day and these out-perform any other walking shoe.Fit is true to size.  I highly recommend to any who walk or stand on their feet for hours a day."
Skechers,2024-03-29,"Light, supportive, color perfect, and great price. I definitely want to recommend these!!!!"
Skechers,2024-01-08,"I love that these are very stylish looking, and they are so comfortable on my wide feet! They are very light weight, and easy to pack in a bag. I get a lot of compliments on them. I wear a size 6 and that;s what I ordered and they fit perfect!"
Skechers,2024-03-27,I loved this shoe right out of the box. This is my first pair of Skechers and I am very pleased. I work in an office and these were very comfortable right out the box. I wear 11 wide and the fit was perfect -- no complaints at all. I plan on wearing these for casual Fridays or when I know I'll be doing more field work. I also plan on trying more Skecher styles.
Skechers,2024-03-05,"I got these shoes when I was 30 weeks pregnant because none of my other closed shoes fit anymore. I wanted something versatile, cute, and slip-on. These definitely did the job! They are comfy and supportive. I walked around in them for hours on multiple occasions. They stretched just enough to continue being comfortable as my feet got bigger at the end of my pregnancy, and I still felt cute. I would highly recommend these, especially if you’re a momma-to-be looking for easy, cute, and comfy shoes!"
Skechers,2024-03-21,Lightweight slip on.  I bought these at a Skechers outlet last year and the Amazon ones seem much lighter.  Not sure if they will hold up like the others but I like them because they are stylish and easy to slip on and off.
Skechers,2024-04-01,"Nice summer color, very comfortable and fits true to size"
Skechers,2024-03-18,Shoe is just right. Very soft step. Love them.
Skechers,2024-03-23,I work on a yacht and have to wear boat shoes at work. I ordered a few of these in different colors two years ago. They are so comfortable and easy to slip on and off. I just bought another pair because I love them so much.
Skechers,2023-12-15,"I ordered the Skechers Go Walk Evolution (size 12 normal width) online to replace my Costco-purchased cheaper Skechers Memory Foam pair since they are no longer available at Costco.  I became very fond of those Skechers since they were lightweight, breathed well, and were durable for my two daily walks.  As an old retired guy (since 2005), I need daily exercise to keep my health up.Anyway, the Costco Skechers were a simpler version that I needed a hook to put on as they were a tight fit with thinner sides, but that was the way they were made.  The sides were not rounded as these Skechers Go Walk pair.  These cost a bit more but are well worth it since I can simply slip my feet into them without assistance and just ""go walk"".  They don't fit as tight as the Costco ones but they still fit perfectly on my feet.  No side movement or pinched toes -- I ordered the same size as the Costco pair.  Still very light and breathable.  I will only know about the durability after many walks in them, but they do look like they should last for some time.Side note:  I read a negative review where a person faulted the shoe for the way the shoe tended to grip the walking surface.  I assumed that was an old person. Almost any new shoe will do that but most wearers know this and adjust.  However, we older folks (I'm very old) must be very aware of this with any new shoe because we are already prone to falls since we tend not to pick our feet up as well as younger folks, which is why we often trip and fall.Anyway, these Skechers will grip the surface very well so one will not slip easily on surfaces.  That is a good thing for seniors!  But they will need to be aware that they must pick up their feet to step and walk.  Humans are adaptable so if I can do this at my age, I know other old folks can, too.I would recommend these to anyone who wants a lightweight, comfortable, easy-to-wear slip-on shoe.  I will be ordering these again when the pair I have wears out.  :)"
Skechers,2024-04-03,"I have really picky feet, never buy shoes on line, cause most of the times they don't fit and hurt my abnormally high foot instep. This time it worked like a charm, the shoes a re great and a perfect fit."
Skechers,2024-04-09,"I bought these shoes for work thinking they would just be some shoes that I could beat up and not care about. They are extremely comfortable, very breathable, and I got the wide size which gives my toes plenty of room. I was actually surprised by how nice they look on foot and wouldn’t mind wearing these outside of work with a casual fit."
Skechers,2024-03-29,"Easy to put in feet. Comfortable. Everyday casual shoes.My husband normally wears size 14 Extra  wide shoes. We purchased size 15. The fit good, not tight."
Skechers,2024-04-07,"Yes they are great for walking and easy to get on and off. That being said if you do plan on walking in them a lot I recommend getting a half size down because they do stretch out after the first few miles of walking. After that they hold shape and are great for 8ish months of every day walking depending on distance and personal build.  If you want these for casual wear then go ahead and give them a healthy coat of water proofing spray and they will last forever. Not for running you will trip and fall. I have had silver, tan, and olive looking colors and they coordinate well with your clothes. O Yea"
Skechers,2024-03-24,"nothing to dislike . product is good , light and confortable all day long"
Skechers,2024-03-23,"Good fit, sturdy & strong. Extremely lightweight Hardly know they  are on."
Skechers,2024-02-24,"This shoe is similar to the Skechers Go Max walking shoe I have already reviewed.  Similar fabric top with an attractive sheen.  The outer sole seems thicker and built more like an athletic sneaker.  The inner sole provides support in cushiony comfort.  The shoes flex nicely, and my feet do not feel pinched nor encased in a  hard shoe.  Another big plus is they are cold water machine washable and then leave out to air dry.  Honestly, these shoes are attractive and I would not mind wearing them when going out to dinner.  Almost forgot, they come in a variety of neutral shades.  And yes, I highly recommend these shoes!"
Skechers,2024-04-13,"Shoes arrived two day early! Wasn't sure what to expect because the reviews were somewhat mixed but after trying them on for the first time, I was impressed on how stylish they looked and how easy they slipped on. The fit was just right and they felt snug and secure not overly tight. They are definitely light weight and they feel as though they breath nicely so if you take a walk, your feet won't feel like they're over heating. I ordered the ""wide fit"" because I need a bit more room at the sides, so these fit well and were comfortable throughout the day. No need to ""cut the strings"" as another viewer suggested. They were designed well to accommodate most people if you choose the fit you actually need. It's nice to be able to slip the shoes on and off with ease as I am at an age where bending over is not as easy as it used to be. But I suppose it doesn't matter how old you are, these Skechers slip-ons are great for any age if only for convenience. Highly recommend!"
Skechers,2024-04-02,"Extremely comfortable shoes.  Exact to listed size.  Easy to slip on. Look to be well made, time will tell.  As long as they turn out to be durable I would buy again."
Skechers,2024-02-29,"A huge plus of course is not needing to pull these on and just slipping into them.. Great at an Airport or just on the go, takes seconds. Comfort is very good, very light weight, I am a heavy walker not sure how these or going to feel after a few miles under them, time will tell.A Plus feature if you have narrow feet get the regulars and if you need to you can cut the laces and use them to get the desired comfort, tie them off and they fit like a glove now and still able to slip them on and off with zero effort, even when I did this. Loved them so much ordered two pairs, one around the house but I recommend Oofo's for that as well, they are the best if you have Plantar fasciitis.Pros:Very ComfortableDo what they say, slip on with easyNot bad lookingLight weightGreat for short walks so far, haven't tried longer than 2 miles.Perfect for travel, easy to removeCan be adjusted if you have narrow feet ""using laces"". Tying them and still be able to slip them on for a more comfortable fit.Cons:Seemed wider than what I am used to for a regular width.Durability ""Unsure"" about this oneLong term comfort ""Unsure""Thicker Shoe heal for more stability!"
Skechers,2024-03-13,"These shoes are great! Comfy, easy Mr Rogers slip on, and look good! But don’t try to sneak up on anybody as every step with my left shoe sounds like I’m stepping on crumpled cellophane. Don’t know if it’s just my pair or all of them that do this but cat burglars need to avoid these."
Skechers,2024-03-29,"I bought my first pair of these Slip Ins when I was going in for surgery and wouldn't be able to tie shoes for a few weeks. I loved that pair so much, I bought this pair and have been wearing them every day ever since...between both pairs, this is almost two years of wearing them constantly and I am a huge fan. Comfortable, slip on without any issues at all, stays on, are super light, affordable, and what else can you ask for? Thumbs up from me."
Skechers,2024-03-26,"Very nice,very light, super comfortable. True to size.These skechers are good quality I wanted to purchase again but unfortunately they run out.Happy with these shoes"
Skechers,2024-04-03,They're light extremely comfortable very easy to get on and off hands down gotta be the best shoe I've ever worn in 57 years they're so good I bought my 77-year-old father appear because it's easier for him to get on and off also these shoes are incredible I will be buying more of them when need be.
Skechers,2024-04-02,Love the slip in feature. I have nerve damage in one leg and it is painful to put on lace up shoes. These are effortless. Nice colors and style too.
Skechers,2024-04-06,"Very comfy out of the box. Nice style, can be worn with jeans, khakis or shorts. Fit is true to size."
Skechers,2024-03-24,"These shoes were much better than I expected.  Comfort, style and durability were second to none.  I am thoroughly enjoying these shoes."
Skechers,2023-11-10,Very comfortable. They are a bit wide but that’s okay for my feet. Look nice dressed up or casual.
Skechers,2024-04-04,"My daughter said “great shoes, trendy and age appropriate”.  These are my new favorites and I typically buy more expensive shoes.  These go with everything and look good with jeans as well as business casual.  I’ll buy them again."
Skechers,2024-04-09,"I got these shoes as a birthday present for my husband, and he just loves them. They look super cute on him, very flattering and go well with both casual and elegant outfits. He says they're also super comfortable and wants to get them in other colors too. Great purchase if you're looking for stylish vegan sneakers."
Skechers,2024-03-20,"Love these shoes, perfect fit & so comfortable, look good too"
Skechers,2023-10-20,"Ordered the 11.5 W. Build quality, comfy insole, and width were all good. Length felt off and was noticeable longer than my other shoes that are all 11.5 Wides. Too hesitant to try to order a smaller size.Recieved the box from Peltz shoes. It comes with detailed instructions on how to process the return. Felt like they were going to reject it so took lots of pictures before shipping with UPS through Amazon Return process. Delivered in Oct. 18th and return started Oct. 19th so let's see."
Skechers,2023-09-21,"We tried out several shoes this summer for my son and this was the winner. Great shoe for the money. He doesn't have a wide foot but he needs a wider toe box, this shoe worked great. Comfortable and stylish as well as affordable. easy to pack in his luggage and worked with many different types of outfits. This was a great find for him!"
Skechers,2024-02-25,"The extra wide width, well designed shape of and comfortable materials used for cushioning, along with the breathable and attractive looking uppers make this an exceptionally nice shoe especially for wearing all day in clean & dry environments.  For example i use mine mainly as slippers /house shoes however they're great casual wear for walking on smooth & dry or carpeted floors or dry paved surfaces just about anywhere."
Skechers,2021-01-17,"OVERVIEWI found these Skechers Avilo loafers to be quite comfortable, an accurate fit, and an overall great everyday shoe.  Hit the mark on the first buy.  I  didn’t have to make multiple attempts to get the 11.5 US size.  No messing around with delays for exchanges or returns - I appreciate that.  The ratings are representative of the shoe.  I reviewed many of the lower and higher ratings - and I will say I side with the higher ratings.AESTHETICSThe fabric color and texture looks just like the picture, but better. The color name “black” seems off - more like grey to me in the picture - and that holds true to actually receiving it.  I am okay with that.  The color shown in the picture is the actual representation.DURABILITYThe elastic holds the shoe on well for everyday things.  For example, worked outside on moderately grass sloped yard doing yard work for an entire day.  Trimmed trees, hauled branches, walked up and down dried grassy slopes.  Walked on decomposed granite - no rocks stuck in my shoes.  Walked across semi-muddy clay areas without great problem. The shoe did not slip off, not even partially.TRACTIONThe sole worked fine for traction.  Wore them over wet concrete, wet vinyl floor, no slipping.  Wore them on fresh light snow day - no issues.  Didn’t try them on wet glossy tile.  (I will post an update when that happens).  Overall these seem to be rather easy to use.COMFORTFor me, I would like a bit more arch support.  If you tend to pronate (roll-in) the you may want an insert for increased comfort.  But I don’t intend to stand all day on hard surfaces so it really doesn’t matter.  Still comfortable.  They are lightweight and not noticeable while wearing.  They did NOT have an incident of slipping off, sliding off, flopping on the heel.CONVENIENCELove the ease of being able to slip the shoes on without untying and retying just to go do some quick tasks (like take the trash out, mailbox walk).  These have become a part of my everyday life.VALUEThese are a good value.  You get a good shoe for the price.  The quality is there and what you expect from Skechers.  Thumbs up.REVIEWThis review is not compensated in any way, shape, or form.  No freebies."
Skechers,2024-03-10,"They look a little smaller/narrower than my other Skechers loafers, but they fit the same (meaning they fit well).  No heel-slip, no crushing of the toes.  The arch support is a bit flatter than I prefer, but not at all bad.  The build quality for mine are pretty good so far.  I haven't worn them enough to get an idea of wear-and-tear."
Skechers,2024-04-09,"So silly me ran a chainsaw over my bare feet and needed stitches. I was travelling 10 days after ""the incident"" and was worried I would have to be wearing sandals all the time. Nearing the departure time I decided to try the slip-ons just to see if any would be comfortable. SO after the goldilocks experiment I found these to be perfect. roomy enough so that the shoe wasn't resting or rubbing on the wound and having the right length that the shoe wasn't falling off. Like I said - perfect fit. Cinderella or Goldilocks - take your pick. All I know is that Sketchers has a fan for life. Oh yeah, The shoes even as it was enclosed around the toe was more comfortable than the sandals I carried. Yayyy"
Skechers,2023-10-22,"I recently purchased the Expected - Avillo casual slip-on sneaker from SKECHERS® for my husband, and it's safe to say he's absolutely smitten with them! Right off the bat, the design speaks volumes about the brand's dedication to marrying style with comfort. The canvas fabric not only brings durability to the table but also showcases a refined, sanded finish that instantly elevates its look.The Relaxed Fit® design is truly the star of the show. My husband has always struggled with finding shoes that accommodate his feet comfortably, but these sneakers, with their generous silhouette, have proven to be a godsend. The added side goring ensures a snug fit, eliminating the age-old issue of shoes slipping off.What he particularly raves about is the Memory Foam insole. He's on his feet a lot during the day, and these provide unparalleled comfort, making it feel like he's walking on clouds. The shock-absorbing midsole paired with the durable rubber outsole offers stability and superior traction, ensuring each step is secure and comfortable.In terms of aesthetics, the contrast stitching detail adds a touch of sophistication to the sneakers, making them versatile enough for both casual outings and semi-formal events. The ventilated environment, thanks to the soft man-made lining, ensures his feet stay fresh, even after long hours of wear.Coming from Skechers, a brand renowned for its dedication to quality and trend-focused designs, I wasn't surprised by the sheer excellence of the Expected - Avillo sneakers. If you're on the hunt for footwear that doesn't compromise on comfort or style, these are a must-have. From utility boots to lifestyle footwear, Skechers' journey has been commendable, and this product just adds another feather to their cap!A big thumbs up for these sneakers! Whether it's a gift for a loved one or a treat for yourself, you can't go wrong with this choice. Highly recommended! 👟🌟"
Skechers,2024-04-05,"It's amazingly comfy and a great fit, one of the best shoes I ever had. Highly recommended"
Skechers,2024-02-16,"I had an good experience with the Sketchers Slip-On's. The loafers are incredibly comfortable, providing ample support throughout the day. I like their stylish design and how easily they were to slip on and off. The quality is great, and I found them to be very durable for everyday wear. Overall, I recommend these loafers for anyone seeking both comfort and style."
Skechers,2024-04-01,"I was searching for a casual shoe that looks nice.The shoes are amazing, xtra wide, feet perfect.Very comfortable for walking and looks great with long pants or dark jeansThe good part if that they are very cheap compared to other brands"
Skechers,2024-03-24,I was very surprised how great of a buy these were. I chose 10.5 size in wide and they fit perfectly. I’d recommend dropping a half size and if you have a thick foot go with the wide sizes as they seem to run small.  These look and feel great!
Skechers,2024-01-28,Bought these for my son who works out in wet weather.  They were not slippery and very comfortable.  True to size.
Skechers,2024-04-10,"These shoes are a true nonslip, super durable waterproof shoe that really works well in the kitchen. The black is super sharp!"
Skechers,2024-04-15,"Received my shoe order yesterday, so far I am very pleased with the fit and comfort.  Even new, they slip on with ease."
Skechers,2023-09-06,"These are in fact slip resistant, they look professional enough, and their easy to clean. But as somebody who has finicky feet my feet are sore after every day at work, which is 8 hours mostly on my feet. The memory foam squishes down to nothing and brings your feet against a very hard bottom of the shoe.I'm going to replace these with better shoes as soon as I can."
Skechers,2024-04-13,I work 12 hr nursing shifts. This is my second pair. Very comfortable and easy to keep clean.
Skechers,2024-04-06,Skechers are pretty darn good shoes. My last pair lasted 5 years and with my weight running a busy kitchen these slip on slip resistant shoes felt great day one. It’s hard for me to find a comfortable work shoe being flat footed and after spending hundreds on shoes for crews I decided to give these a try. These felt great day one but I think this shoe may run a little small. I wear a 11.5 wide and bought a 12 wide and feel a little cramped. I believe once their broken in they will be just about right and for the price feel way better than the twice the price shoes for crews.
Skechers,2024-03-26,"I have wide feet and have struggled to find a good, reliable work shoe that was comfortable and effective. I wore Keen work shoes for many years which I liked, though there was always an uncomfortable break-in period with them. I decided to give these a try and I'm so glad I did! There was no break-in period at all. Comfortable right out of the box. I've been wearing them for several months now and they're holding up well and still very comfortable. I couldn't be happier with them. Plus at such a great price!"
Skechers,2024-03-28,"Very confortable, sturdy product lTight Fit, which is what I require.Just don't try to sneak up on anyone, they squeek (just a little)."
Skechers,2024-03-27,"I used them 24 to 30 hours every week for my fast food job and they were able to hold up for 8 months. They’re comfortable and have good room; never caused any pain standing all day. It is non slip but you still have to be careful because they could be a bit more grippy. After 8 months, the left shoe bottom has separated"
Skechers,2024-04-02,"I am a longtime user of Sketcher shoes, years! This time however, my high school aged son who is now working at Dairy Queen, needed a pair of good working shoes, that will hold up against slippery floors, water and ice cream falling on them. He told me that these were the most comfortabl shoes he has ever had, and not up against his athletic shoes, but any shoe he has ever worn. I like to think I just made him a Sketcher fan for life, just like I am."
Skechers,2024-01-10,"I do dishwashing / prep for a living and these are essential. I would never walk into a dishroom or kitchen without special nonslip work shoes ever again. Don't try to get away with ""black soled"" shoes or whatever is in your closet. These even kind of look cool in a ""I don't care what I'm wearing"" kind of way. I wear them all the time. The non slip hasn't worn out either. I walk to work in them and to the grocery store, etc. I've had them about 6 months of regular use and they are holding up, sole hasn't come off. I think I bought some gel inserts though. I guess I forgot about that. I would definitely buy gel inserts if you can."
Skechers,2024-03-23,Nice comfortable shoe
Skechers,2024-02-23,"I ordered 14 regular shoes. They fit ok lengthwise,  but they were very wide.  They looked liked wide shoes.  Ugly and looked like they were the footwear of someone substantially heavier than me."
Skechers,2024-04-04,These work shoes always hold up well and are very comfortable I work on a concrete floor 8 hours a day
Skechers,2024-04-16,Skechers is usually my go to for sneakers. I purchased these for an upcoming trip to Ireland & Scotland. I've only wore them around the house at this point but they are very comfortable and I believe they'll hold up well to the 18 rounds in their future.
Skechers,2024-04-16,Good support and a good fit
Skechers,2024-01-18,"Great look, great fit and one of the most comfortable pair of shoes I've ever had!"
Skechers,2024-02-07,Very comfortable shoes and size 10 is a perfect fit
Skechers,2023-12-20,Very happy with quality and comfort
Skechers,2023-05-06,Would like Sketchers to start making this shoe available in US.  Great shoe and comfortable.  I have had maybe 4 pairs over several years and certainly would order this shoe again if they did not ship only from UK as my last order got lost.  I did get a refund and Amazon people were very helpful
Skechers,2021-04-01,"Light and airy moc-proto-sneaker and walking shoe. The ""California Rake"" (ramps up from front to rear) in the sole/heel layer put your balance just a small fraction forward giving one the odd feeling to get going and walk or even run. LoL.  I bought these to replace my last pair which I was most happy with, but the reputable and venerable old major supplier of the genre kept the name of the model but changed it considerably to where it was unrecognizable. This Sketchers Boat shoe comes the closest to that which I'm trying to replace. I read a review or two where the buyer mentioned having a choice of widths. This current seller gave no such choice of widths.  Had I a choice, I would have gone up a width size for a canvas shoe as I have a wide foot. Though most size 10's fit well, I sometimes have to go up a width size. it all depends on the manufacturer's guarded ""lasts"". But these felt so nice, I couldn't let them go back on the truck. If I find a wider pair from this mfr, I'll buy them too! LoL.  Either way, they fit 95% perfect on a quick mail order and I was finally able to replace my old last 2 pairs of boat shoes. I've been wearing boat shoes every year when I'm on my own time for the past half century. I highly recommend this leisure shoe, though I can't vouch for usage on a boat since I havn't been on one in the past few years. I was on fishing boats all summer in my younger yrs and these shoes certainly feel like I'd have given them a try wiith confidence!"
Skechers,2023-09-15,"comfortable,light casual shoe  could use a little more arch support, Good price point/quality"
Skechers,2023-12-28,Loved color and fit
Skechers,2023-09-12,Sketchers are the most comfortable shoes by far. These are so great to wear around the marina and at the boat. I love the casual look and the comfort. Sketchers are always a winner.
Skechers,2024-03-23,"I have wide feet and have always had a hard time finding comfortable shoes. And now, my feet are not only wide but bony and arthritic.  So I figured I'd try the Skechers and I'm both shocked and pleasantly so. The size and width are as described.  Equally important is that they are very well padded, reduce the pressure on the bony protuberances and they are truly comfortable. I can recommend these shoes/sneakers to all with wide feet including folks who require a padding for their feet. They also seem well-made and time will tell. But a great value for the price ."
Skechers,2024-03-17,"These Sketchers are nice and keep their appearance. Comfortable for walking long distances and nice enough for a night out. Great for travel, too."
Skechers,2023-12-29,"I was looking for a casual shoe to wear with jeans and shorts - around the house or on weekends.  The Sketchers are definitely easy to put on - just slide in, the heels are stiff enough that they don't get mashed by my heels. The soles and insoles are comfortable and supportive.  The uppers are a little loose but not too bad - probably necessary for the slip-on style.  They're great for driving long distances.  I'm not really thrilled with the way they look when I'm wearing them.  Not sure how much I'll wear them in public."
Skechers,2024-04-04,these are by far the best sneakers Ive ever whore there so lite and comfortable and true to size
Skechers,2024-03-10,I bought these before a three month trip to Europe.  Very comfy and fairly durable on the streets of the Old World.  They passed as my dress shoes a couple of times too.
Skechers,2024-04-15,"Title says it all,  Very comfortable, easy on, easy off, look sharp."
Skechers,2024-04-15,"I found these to be quite comfortable, easy to put on and good-looking shoes. Unfortunately, the mesh in the toe box is not very durable and before too long, my big toe wore a hole through the mesh. There seems to be a ""wear"" layer inside the mesh, but it doesn't come up far enough to protect more of the mesh where my toe poked through. First pair of shoes I've had where the tops wore out before the soles. Wish the design was a bit different."
Skechers,2024-04-13,Very comfortable easy to walk in unfortunately a little big but that’s my fault. Just wear two pairs of socks with them.
Skechers,2023-08-01,"I've been looking for golf shoes for quite some time and I recently wore a pair of Skechers sneakers and the comfort was fantastic. I was hoping this comfort would translate to their golf shoes and these did not disappoint! The shoe itself is very good looking with the white water resistant top and the purple sole and interior. A really good looking golf shoe. The comfort is truly insane and to date, the best golf shoe I have ever owned and I have owned some very expensive shoes over the 20+ years of golfing. Just keep in mind that these are water repellent and not water proof when purchasing, which might make a difference for those who golf year round. I live in the Northeast and I'm not golfing year round so I cannot speak to how well they will hold up but they seem pretty solid thus far. Honestly, I believe you will be quite pleased with these shoes and the price is very good for the comfort and quality you are getting. Truly a great purchase!"
Skechers,2024-03-26,Very comfortable and true to size!Wore them  with no problems and walked the course no need to break them in!
Skechers,2024-02-20,They are very good looking … and so comfortable and so reasonably priced !
Skechers,2023-12-10,"These golf shoes are so comfortable! I really enjoy wearing them.  I wear an arch support in them and they still fit fine.The only thing I don’t like is that the soles, although gripping well, do pick up dead leaves & debris and require cleaning after a game. That’s why I scored them as a 4."
Skechers,2024-02-19,Very comfortable and true to size.  I bought the 7 wide and they fit perfectly.
Skechers,2024-04-03,Comfort and long lasting!
Skechers,2024-03-16,Like the color and good grip soles !
Skechers,2023-10-11,"This is the second pair of these golf shoes I bought. I thought the first pair were just poorly constructed, the tops cracked and separated after a short time. I thought I would try them again because there are comfortable, I bought them only a few months ago and they fell apart! Of course the return date is only 30 days so I am unable to get a refund. DO NOT BUY THESE SHOES OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE SECONDS AND NOT MADE WELL!"
Skechers,2024-04-14,The shoes are so perfect... feet do not hurt after one or two rounds in the same day!! Perfect!!
Skechers,2024-04-15,I bought these shoes because I feel the mesh is very comfortable
Skechers,2024-04-14,Muy buen artículo!
Skechers,2024-03-22,Fit good and comfortable!  Golf
Skechers,2024-03-31,"Good price,  comfortable shoe, probably will order another pair to keep on shelf."
Skechers,2024-04-05,Great fit - half sizes were irrelevant?
Skechers,2024-04-05,Comfortable and well priced
Skechers,2024-04-01,Nice comfortable golf shoes
Skechers,2024-03-18,"I bought them for my wife and she loves them. Great fit, nice looking, and comfortable."
Skechers,2024-02-28,These are light weight and super comfortable. I take out the inserts and put in my own for more support. These are casual and look nice with everything. They also work if you have to do some walking. I only wish the bottom was more slip resistant. These are so lightweight they can also be used for house shoes. Not an overly supportive shoe but nice for the house or casual wear.
Skechers,2024-03-12,I use these for regular walking and work. The comfort is wonderful and allows for arch support if needed. True fit!
Skechers,2024-03-15,"This pair of Skecher boat shoes is very light partly because it is not made of leather and is machine washable.  It is soft, light and comfortable.  It is half the price of the ones that are made of leather.  Hopefully, it is just as durable.I have never bought Skecher brand!  Much to my surprise, it is as comfortable as Sperry.Jury is still out on whether it is as durable.  It remains to be seen."
Skechers,2024-01-29,"My wife loves this shoe.  It's very light weight and comfortable.  There's not much in the support area, but works well for its purpose."
Skechers,2024-03-24,I was ready for a shoe with a little more style than a simple slip-on.  The fit is perfect.
Skechers,2024-03-21,"These shoes fit perfectly.  I wore them all day the first day, no breaking in time needed.  They are so comfortable.  Great shoe"
Skechers,2024-04-15,I am a perfect sized 7Wide. Skechers site rarely has the ones I want. I'm so happy to find more wide width shoes here on Amazon. These are so comfortable and lightweight. I want to get the tan ones also. The navy blue was my first choice.
Skechers,2024-03-11,"I bought it to try since the price was affordable for a stylish golf shoe and it was water resistant.Haven’t gotten to test out water resistance with heavy moisture but my foot stayed dry in light rains so far.The shoe is comfortable and padded well. I also like the spikeless pattern on the sole. There’s enough grip to stay grounded on the swing but nothing too destructive to punch up the greens as you measure that 3 foot putt you’re going to miss.Great shoe, great value."
Skechers,2024-03-18,"These golf shoes fit well and, since I ordered the WIDE size, they are extremely comfortable on my wide feet.  I highly recommend them."
Skechers,2024-03-31,I wanted a pair of white comfortable golf shoes in these were perfect I'm only giving it four stars though because I'll probably just get 2 years most out of them but you can't beat the price and the comfortability and the looks they look great
Skechers,2024-01-01,"I come from the old school- I grew up with metal spikes. I eventually embraced the soft spikes, but only on shoes that they could be replaced. This is my first pair of shoes without replaceable spikes, and I am easing into the idea. I do love the light weight of these for sure. I'm wary of the water resistance. I previously couldn't afford more than one pair of shoes, but now I can have a couple of pairs in the rotation. My thought is to wear these on warm days when the course is dry, and if conditions are wetter I would go to another pair that is more waterproof. I am not sure about the durability of the traction ""spikes"", but these are a lower cost alternative to shoes with replaceable spikes.So far I'm pleased and will continue to evaluate, these appear to be a good addition to the arsenal."
Skechers,2024-03-20,Incredibly comfortable and look good.
Skechers,2024-04-08,it's a good product at a great price.  Nothing to complain about it.
Skechers,2024-03-09,Very comfortable golf shoes. Will buy another if the price is right.
Skechers,2024-03-06,"I ordered 9.5,  not 9.5 extra wide!  I really like the looks of the shoe and the stable tread but the size comes larger than the stated size.  Although a 9.5, the shoe is really closer to a 10.  I was disappointed to see the extra wide size because I have a narrow foot.  I tend to slew around in these on the golf course. If they had come as I ordered, the shoe would be very comfortable and stable."
Skechers,2024-03-15,i have slender feet and ordered a half size bigger and they fit perfectly. they look like docs but are actually comfortable. the only con is they get stained really easy
Skechers,2024-04-10,This oxford may look heavy but it's actually very light. They run true to size. I wear a size 9. I didn't have to break them in like another brand I tried. The toe box is also very roomy.
Skechers,2024-03-23,"These are the best shoes I've ever worn. Had 2 knees done I needed something for support standing long hours. My feet did not hurt, no back aches. I would definitely recommend"
Skechers,2024-02-23,"Absolutely love the style, materials and coloring of this shoe. However, I can’t wear them all day as they hurt my feet. I initially purchased them for work since I’m on my feet a lot but have since made them more of a shoe for my days off."
Skechers,2024-02-29,"I ended buying these because I got a pair secondhand turned out to be quite old and started stripping on first wear.  Bought them again because the fit of these is really great-  design-wise, they're not far off from the oxford style of Docs, which I love.  Despite owning several pairs of those, I still appreciate these, since they have a wider toe box, are more geared towards comfort than longevity, and they've actually got half sizes, which means that you can get a really good fit."
Skechers,2023-11-01,Bought my size (8) but had to return them for .5 a size smaller (7.5) & those fit great. The toe part is very spacious which is why you sometimes have to size down. They’re sturdy and so cute to style! Going to be wearing these all fall.
Skechers,2024-02-04,"I have foot and back problems! These are wonderful. Not heavy. Good arch support. My back doest hurt as much when I've worn these all day, and that's saying a lot! Highly recommend!"
Skechers,2024-03-22,"These appear to be made well, but I find them very uncomfortable.  I don't feel like there is arch support.  They are very firm and stiff.  I wore them several times thinking I could break them in so I can't return them.  I wish I had just returned them the first time I put them on."
Skechers,2024-02-01,"Usually wear a Size US 9 and/or EU 40 fairly reliably. Ordered the Skechers Slip-in in a Size 9. Too small! Pinched my forefoot in the toebox area, and squished my big toenail on each foot. No go. Returned that shoe. (Thank you, Whole Foods drop off!) Ordered a Size 9 Wide. Too big! My foot slid around inside the shoe while walking, and the shoe slid off the top of my heel at the back of my foot. Ok, then. Exchanged that shoe with a Size 8.5 Wide. JUST RIGHT! Omg, y’all. Finally, a solid fit! Just enough room in the toebox for my forefoot to spread out, and a sturdy, steady grip at the heel. Great arch support, and heel cushioning, too. A really comfortable, easy-wearing shoe for every day running around. 🙂👍"
Skechers,2024-02-27,"OMG is exactly what i said the first time i slipped on this shoe. So easy to step in to,  fit perfectly,  doesn't look clunky.  I have had back issues for about a year,  and putting on shoes was something I dreaded because it almost always caused my back to hurt.  But no more! I have done my neighborhood walk,  and spent most of today in them doing various activities out and about,  and my feet feel great!  I have always loved Skechers, and this slip on version is like heaven for my feet.  If you are thinking about getting slip on shoes,  I highly recommend these."
Skechers,2024-03-08,Bought these for my  88 year old mother.She is thrilled with how easy she can get her shoes on without help!!!! She states how she just steps right into them and getting off is just as easyShe also loves the material and how they feel on her feet and they look great too!!
Skechers,2024-04-08,"Love the color, the ease of slipping them on and off, the support and they’re cute."
Skechers,2024-03-28,"I recently purchased the Skechers Women's Hands-Free Slip Ins Ultra Flex 3.0 Smooth Step Sneaker, and I couldn't be happier! Let me share why these sneakers have become my new favorites:👉 Effortless Style: These slip-ons' sleek design immediately caught my eye.

Happy walking! 🚶‍♀️👟"
Skechers,2024-02-16,"You will want to buy these shoes! From my first step I felt like I was walking in slippers! Divine. Truly step in as advertised. True to size. The shoes do not slip or slide at all, due to the way they have been made."
Skechers,2024-03-24,"Very comfortable, supportive, attractive and they slide on and off easily."
Skechers,2024-04-04,"My wife really likes these, she said for her they are easy to slip on without having to bend down, and very comfortable. She thought the price was a bit high, but worth it in the long run."
Skechers,2024-02-22,Great price on these shoes. Great shoe if your are looking for something to upgrade too. True to size and comfy as heck.
Skechers,2024-03-09,"I have always LOOKED at Skeechers but never bought them, Always the Nike or Addidas. Wellnever again, this is THE most comfortable shoe and the spikeless bottom is anything but that!Unreal traction and did I mention comfortable!? Supper light and they come in wide sizes, thankyour very much for that.  So yeah buy some Skeechers, because they aint skeechey!"
Skechers,2024-03-28,Hubby loves these shoes.  They fit right out of the box and he says they are really comfortable and the color is perfect.  He got the grey size 10.  He has already recommended then to other golfers as they noticed right away he had these neat new golf shoes
Skechers,2023-12-16,"I like the sketchers golf shoe product. This is the third pair of golf shoes I have purchased. This last pair was a different model from the first two.Overall, a nice fit. A little heavier feel than the other ones I bought. Good grip, haven't felt my feet slip out at all.The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because they don't breathe well. My feet don't usually sweat but they do in these shoes."
Skechers,2024-03-21,"Great sneakers, good price, well made comfortable, makes my golf game better"
Skechers,2024-04-01,They fit well and were very comfortable playing several rounds.  My feet didn’t hurt at all.  Highly recommended!!
Skechers,2024-03-07,Love my first use of my Sketchers golf shoes! The durable short spikes are stable and secured my footing! Comfortable fitting with a tennis shoe style comfort.
Skechers,2024-03-20,"Good looking, very comfortable and easy on your feet."
Skechers,2024-02-19,"These arrived in a very timely fashion. They were comfortable from the get go. My feet slid into them, hands free, with no trouble.  They're very attractive. They're machine washable! I'm totally pleased.  So much so that I  ordered a pair of Skechers hands free in black to wear during winter weather.  They arrived today.  They are very comfortable, good looking and my feet slid into them, hands free, with no problem. This pair, too, is machine washable."
Skechers,2024-03-24,"Just what I wanted! Fit is perfect, comfortable. I will be getting another or in different color!"
Skechers,2024-03-26,"Love that they are slip ons, look adorable with jeans!"
Skechers,2024-04-11,"I’m a size 6 in shoes. I got these in my normal size, and they feel tight. Not painful, but not comfortable at all. I love them though, so I guess I’ll be returning them for a 6.5"
Skechers,2024-03-21,These are wonderful just slip in and go. I look nice with blue jeans. They’re very comfortable. Just love them.
Skechers,2024-03-15,"I love this step-in feature.  It makes putting on shoes so easy.  I’ve purchased two pair for a granddaughter & one pair for myself.  The sizing is generous. So a half size down might be advised.  There is not much of an arch support, which is fine for me, but be warned.  I find them very comfortable & I’m happily wearing them every day."
Skechers,2024-03-08,"These shoes are the bomb!  Cute, comfortable and the fit was spot on!!  I love my new summer Skechers."
Skechers,2024-04-16,"Very strange-they slipped on easily, but literally pinched my small toes on both feet so badly my toes would go numb. They were cute, but not comfortable at all."
Skechers,2024-04-11,"Fits perfectly, very lightweight but sturdy and very comfortable"
Skechers,2024-04-09,They are so nice.  They fit my feet well and are so comfortable to walk in.  Easy to slip into.  Will be ordering not color in this style!
Skechers,2024-04-05,"I love everything about this shoe.  Comfy spongie insole, easy on, easy off.  I have had hip surgery and tying shoes or doing anything around my feet is difficult.  These shoes are making my life so much easier.  Attractive, light, cool, well padded.  Very happy feet!"
Skechers,2024-03-06,These shoes are very lightweight and comfortable. Nice material too.  I normally wear a wide shoe but these seem a bit loose and do not feel like a good sturdy shoe. Too much give for me.  So will be returning.
Skechers,2024-04-06,"These shoes are a perfect fit and are SO comfortable!  I appreciate this Seller offering shoes where we can choose the width size of the shoe.  Not many Sellers do this and I won't buy from any Seller who will not offer a width size.  The shoes are gorgeous, dark blue with white soles.  I love them and highly recommend this Seller."
Skechers,2024-03-28,I wear Sketcher brand walking shoes almost daily and find them to be very comfortable and supportive. These slip-ins are equally as comfortable and the price is better than I can find at our local outlet.  True to size.
Skechers,2024-04-11,I can't say enough about these comfortable shoes. I have neuropathy and it's hard for me to find a shoe that's comfortable. I looked high and low and finally ran across these and I read the reviews. They are so comfortable I could wear them all day. And they are pretty. This is navy blue I want to get a few more pair in different colors. In other tennis shoes like Nikes I wear a nine but in Skechers I wear my size 8 1/2. I actually ordered a 9 and a 8 1/2 just to make sure that one of them fit. The 8  1/2 fit perfect. They look so nice with my blue jeans I mainly wear them to doctor's appointments hair appointments stuff like that. I don't wear these for my long walking which you could but I need just a little bit more support in the ankle. I definitely give them five stars. And I highly recommend them.
Skechers,2024-04-15,"I bought these for an upcoming trip to London because of the number of positive reviews, and I wore them for about 2 weeks prior to our trip just to make sure they were what I wanted (I'm a school teacher and do a fair bit of walking everyday).  They're great!  Comfortable, easy to put on and take off, very little slippage, and very light weight.  Also, cute!!!  I was so excited, I bought two more pairs in other colors.Cue to our very recent trip to London.  7 days of sightseeing, using the tubes to get where we needed.  By Day 2, I had a tiny blister on the ball of my foot.  Figured it was because of increased walking, but okay.  By the end of Day 3, that blister was a bit larger and a new formed on the side of my heel.  By Day 4, I had a third blister on my other heel, and I was forced to drain the first blister because I could barely walk.  By Day 5, all the blisters were bigger (the one I had drained had developed new ones around it), I was trying to drain the remaining two.  By Day 6-7, the pain was near-unbearable.  I had been using blister patches for days, but still.  Things were made worse with our trip home when one of the patches slipped off and got wedged under my toes and rubbing that area raw.  Being in the airport and airplane, there was no real space for me to take off my shoes to air out my feet and blisters.  I got home last night, and the drained blisters had crusted over and refilled, one with blood.So while these shoes may be now a decent choice for light daily walking, I cannot recommend them for intense, vigorous walking."
Skechers,2024-02-19,"First off, my husband is a one pair of shoes at a time guy. He buys a pair and wears them to work, church, going out, you name it. Unless it calls for a winter boot or a dress shoe. He’s wearing a version of these sketchers. With daily use these hold up great! We get about 6 months out of each pair and simply order a new one. He started with the grey ones, then the beige, now the all black. We’ve liked all the colors, they all go well with a variety of his wardrobe. I’d say the grey are the most versatile.Hes on his feet all day and never complains of pain or discomfort with these. And I love that they can be easily slipped off when when he enters the house!The fit is standard and shipping is quick, through the different colors the sizes have been consistent as well!I see a lot of men in these and overall they look good and are really functional!Highly suggest!"
Skechers,2024-03-02,These were a great choice.  Normally I need to try on shoes in person but these were a great fit.  They are stylish and very comfortable.
Skechers,2024-04-02,"We own these shoes in multiple colors. They are great for anyone that is on their feet all the time. Lots of support, true to size, and stylish can we worn dressed up or just casually."
Skechers,2024-03-01,I have purchased this same pair three times over. They look good with almost any outfit and are extremely comfortable.My only gripe is I’ve had to purchase these multiple times because Skechers aren’t very durable. The insole falls apart after 6 months and the tread will go bald. I’ll still buy another pair after these fall apart.
Skechers,2024-02-15,"My son is 14 and is on the Autism spectrum, so he’s incredibly sensitive to shoes & clothing.  He normally only wears crocs shoes but needed a pair of runners for PE class & long distance walking.I love that these shoes are easy to slip on, have a wide option and are super comfortable for him. I literally ordered 6 different types of shoes for him to try on at home, as taking him shoe shopping can be difficult for him. I even ordered a more expensive brand (Kizik) and he ended up choosing these sneakers (half the price) as they were the best fitting for him.The quality and style is awesome, but the fit is hands downs what is the best thing about this style. It has a soft gel type insole that moulds to his foot and he’s able to wear these all day without complaining his feet hurt.If you’re on the fence about buying these, try them! Amazon has an amazing return policy which is why I love shopping here."
Skechers,2024-03-25,"Bought these for some comfortable shoes for throwing in cornhole tournaments. And these shoes are great, so lightweight and comfortable. I ended up getting 2 pairs of these. One pair is a half size over the first pair I got to accommodate a thicker sock if I want it. Love these and they really look good also."
Skechers,2024-04-02,"My husband loves his gray ""dress sneaker"" Skechers, but they're getting a bit worn. So I got him these and he opted for the tan to have something different. They are neat-looking and classy enough for work outfits and restaurants, but also comfortable and plain enough for casual settings. We love the versatility. They also earned a nod of approval and nice compliment from our teen, so apparently they pass as ""non-embarrassing"" as well."
Skechers,2024-02-21,"These are comfortable, light, and supportive, while still being attractive and not frumpy -- plus not expensive.  The holy grail of shoes.  I've bought several colors for my husband because he loves them and wears the heck out of them."
Skechers,2024-04-08,"Love! Roomy for a wide foot. I wear an 11.5 wide. I have walked in them for weeks, and they are comfortable, they breath and they look great. Highly recommend! Will purchase more colors for next fall season."
Skechers,2024-04-13,Very comfortable. Good looking. True to size. I'll be buying more!
Skechers,2024-02-28,The right shoe is too big for me?? but very cute. I might order a smaller size.
Skechers,2024-04-12,Sketchers don't disappoint...very comfortable and fit well...look nice too!
Skechers,2024-03-24,These shoes I bought because I love Sketchers shoes. So comfortable and these looked nice enough to wear to church.They had them in all different colors!No I didn’t go to the Mall to buy them! I ordered them from Amazon because I have ordered many pairs of shoes and really liked the fit! I have never sent any back that didn’t fit.I got a grease spot on the top and put them on a casual cycle on the washer and when they finished drying they looked brand new!Win Win!
Skechers,2024-04-07,Sketchers are my go to shoes. They always fit and last forever! Super comfy and podiatrist recommended years ago. I’ll buy again!!
Skechers,2024-01-10,"I normally wear 9 or 9.5 WW shoes,, which are very hard to find, and when located are expensive.  I was pleased when a friend told me that some women’s Skecher shoes come in wide width and would be wide enough to accommodate my WW foot.  So, I tried these and other Skecher styles.  Yes.  The wides can accommodate a WW foot.  But Skechers makes its wide shoes so wide that the heel slips whenever I walk and I can’t keep them on my feet.  I liked this shoe.  It didn’t have much arch support or cushion, but it was comfortable enough and dressy enough that it looked good with dress slacks.  I tried putting a forefoot cushion into the shoe to push my foot back into the heel.  Nope.  I tried putting a pad into the heel to better grip my foot.  Nope.  I tried both remedies.  Nope.  Couldn’t keep the backs from flipping up and down.  I’m desperate for attractive, comfortable WW or equivalent shoes that fit both the front and back of my foot.  These were returned."
Skechers,2024-03-14,"First pair of sketchers closed toe shoe. True to size though. They seemed a bit tight at first, I wear and 8 but because this shoe a crocheted fabric, I opted to keep them as I know they will stretch a bit. Overall, a great work shoe :) Very happy"
Skechers,2024-03-24,"I have been wearing these for years and they work well for a shop environment,  soft and flexible with good support,  I can't wear a steel toe or work boot type shoe for what I do and I  like these"
Skechers,2024-04-03,Fit as expected and look very good for work sneakers.  Comfortable.
Skechers,2024-01-16,Great shoes for restaurant work. Comfortable.  Not totally slip proof. Haven't slipped but have slid.
Skechers,2023-11-19,"Bought these a year ago they have held up well. Nice fit and comfortable, have walked a lot in these sneakers at work. Buying another pair since the sole bottoms are wearing a bit after a year of use. These are great sneakers for the price."
Skechers,2024-03-04,"For many years I have always purchased the Skechers Felton model...twice a year.  However, this time I couldn't find my size/wide width.  Also, the Felton model is no longer featured on the Skechers website.  I think the Dighton model is the new replacement...because as far as I can tell it is almost identical to the former Felton...just a slight cosmetic update.Update.  After wearing the Dighton for a week in the restaurant I realized that the ""toe box"" is wider.  It is definitely a more comfortable shoe than the Felton.  I think that's the only difference."
Skechers,2024-03-29,"I love these sketches they are good, reliable, work shoes at a great price recommend very highly"
Skechers,2024-01-27,Thought shoes would have lasted longer than 4 months. Bottom of soles held up but outside material on top and sides started peeling off.
Skechers,2024-03-26,"I found these shoes to be very comfortable. Walking constantly on my security patrols I need these comfortable, casual and slip resistant shoes."
Skechers,2023-11-06,I have been for wearing  lace up Skeechers for years but I have a physical problem trying to bend down and tie the laces. It was very difficult for me to put on my shoes. This has now changed. These are breeze to put on.It is as easy as the commercials say. No bending or pushing They are very comfortable and look good. Since I don't have to wear dress shoes any more I guess I have a new way of dressing.  I will probably order another pair in a different color. I highly recommend these.
Skechers,2023-12-31,"Great comfort, good instep cushioning and I have one foot with flat arch..  Slip on easy, size accurate.  Have purchased two pair..  look nice."
Skechers,2024-03-18,"My husband has hard to fit, wide feet.  These fit and were comfortable.  They looked really nice with his jeans.  Much dressier than his usual sneakers but with all of the comfort of sneaker."
Skechers,2024-04-12,"I am enjoying the easy slip on feature. No using a shoe horn anymore. They look great, too!"
Skechers,2024-01-27,"First got a pair of these loafers in my normal size, and Skechers is usually on the money, but this time they were not a good fit. More specifically, the right shoe was too big at the heel, so when I walked around my right heel would pop out. I double checked that both shoes were the same and expected size. Exchanged the pair for the next half size down, and now I have a better fit (although the right shoe is still slightly roomier at the heel than the left, but not enough to be a problem again).Other than the initial fitment problem, the shoes look good, are comfortable for wearing around the house on a daily basis, and, importantly, my feet don't get too hot in them.The full star off in the rating is due to the fitment issue and because of the high price. Not sure these are worth the $80 price tag, but they better at least last a good while."
Skechers,2024-04-11,"Shoe fits well, pleased."
Skechers,2024-02-09,"I bought these for my father, he is 87 and has swollen feet from medication.  He loves the fact he can just step right into them.  Says they are comfortable also.  May buy another pair in a different color."
Skechers,2024-02-23,Excellent shoes.  I had purchased the exact shoe before and they were great and easy to slip in and out. I did unfortunately select a wide size but should have stayed with the regular width. My fault. Sizes run true. Returned them but wouldn’t hesitate to purchase this shoe design in the future.
Skechers,2024-04-16,"These are comfortable, light weight walking shoes, I think a good buy for the money and true to size.  I am walking 2-3 miles a day and  they seem to be holding up well"
Skechers,2023-04-02,The only Shoes I wear.
Skechers,2024-03-23,These Skechers are just really comfortable and a perfect fit. I usually take a size10 in skechers sandals and shoes but find I need a size up for training shoes.  These ate fabulous walking shoes as they offer great support and cushioning for the feet ... I  recommend these trainers ... you won't be disappointed.
Skechers,2022-03-27,Just received these a few days ago. I have only worn them in the house so far due to recent rain.I ordered a half size up and they are really comfortable and lightweight. Traction on sole is also good. Ready to enjoy spring morning walks!
Skechers,2024-03-27,Sketchers never disappoints. Subtle style with a lot of comfort.
Skechers,2023-03-02,Extremely comfortable!
Skechers,2024-03-28,"These walking shoes are very comfortable, but I have to size up! I'm a true 7.5 with medium width feet and ordered these in 7.5 regular. Wearing exercise socks, my toes reached all the way to the end of the shoe and my pinky toes were slightly pressed in. There was no wiggle room at all.I'm going for size 8!"
Skechers,2020-09-23,"This is my second pair of Sketchers Go Walk and they are the most comfortable sneaker.  They are soft, have goodarch support and a solid gripping sole.  I walk 2-3 miles a day and these out-perform any other walking shoe.Fit is true to size.  I highly recommend to any who walk or stand on their feet for hours a day."
Skechers,2024-03-29,"Light, supportive, color perfect, and great price. I definitely want to recommend these!!!!"
Skechers,2024-01-08,"I love that these are very stylish looking, and they are so comfortable on my wide feet! They are very light weight, and easy to pack in a bag. I get a lot of compliments on them. I wear a size 6 and that;s what I ordered and they fit perfect!"
Skechers,2024-03-27,I loved this shoe right out of the box. This is my first pair of Skechers and I am very pleased. I work in an office and these were very comfortable right out the box. I wear 11 wide and the fit was perfect -- no complaints at all. I plan on wearing these for casual Fridays or when I know I'll be doing more field work. I also plan on trying more Skecher styles.
Skechers,2024-03-05,"I got these shoes when I was 30 weeks pregnant because none of my other closed shoes fit anymore. I wanted something versatile, cute, and slip-on. These definitely did the job! They are comfy and supportive. I walked around in them for hours on multiple occasions. They stretched just enough to continue being comfortable as my feet got bigger at the end of my pregnancy, and I still felt cute. I would highly recommend these, especially if you’re a momma-to-be looking for easy, cute, and comfy shoes!"
Skechers,2024-03-21,Lightweight slip on.  I bought these at a Skechers outlet last year and the Amazon ones seem much lighter.  Not sure if they will hold up like the others but I like them because they are stylish and easy to slip on and off.
Skechers,2024-04-01,"Nice summer color, very comfortable and fits true to size"
Skechers,2024-03-18,Shoe is just right. Very soft step. Love them.
Skechers,2024-03-23,I work on a yacht and have to wear boat shoes at work. I ordered a few of these in different colors two years ago. They are so comfortable and easy to slip on and off. I just bought another pair because I love them so much.
Skechers,2023-12-15,"I ordered the Skechers Go Walk Evolution (size 12 normal width) online to replace my Costco-purchased cheaper Skechers Memory Foam pair since they are no longer available at Costco.  I became very fond of those Skechers since they were lightweight, breathed well, and were durable for my two daily walks.  As an old retired guy (since 2005), I need daily exercise to keep my health up.Anyway, the Costco Skechers were a simpler version that I needed a hook to put on as they were a tight fit with thinner sides, but that was the way they were made.  The sides were not rounded as these Skechers Go Walk pair.  These cost a bit more but are well worth it since I can simply slip my feet into them without assistance and just ""go walk"".  They don't fit as tight as the Costco ones but they still fit perfectly on my feet.  No side movement or pinched toes -- I ordered the same size as the Costco pair.  Still very light and breathable.  I will only know about the durability after many walks in them, but they do look like they should last for some time.Side note:  I read a negative review where a person faulted the shoe for the way the shoe tended to grip the walking surface.  I assumed that was an old person. Almost any new shoe will do that but most wearers know this and adjust.  However, we older folks (I'm very old) must be very aware of this with any new shoe because we are already prone to falls since we tend not to pick our feet up as well as younger folks, which is why we often trip and fall.Anyway, these Skechers will grip the surface very well so one will not slip easily on surfaces.  That is a good thing for seniors!  But they will need to be aware that they must pick up their feet to step and walk.  Humans are adaptable so if I can do this at my age, I know other old folks can, too.I would recommend these to anyone who wants a lightweight, comfortable, easy-to-wear slip-on shoe.  I will be ordering these again when the pair I have wears out.  :)"
Skechers,2024-04-03,"I have really picky feet, never buy shoes on line, cause most of the times they don't fit and hurt my abnormally high foot instep. This time it worked like a charm, the shoes a re great and a perfect fit."
Skechers,2024-04-09,"I bought these shoes for work thinking they would just be some shoes that I could beat up and not care about. They are extremely comfortable, very breathable, and I got the wide size which gives my toes plenty of room. I was actually surprised by how nice they look on foot and wouldn’t mind wearing these outside of work with a casual fit."
Skechers,2024-03-29,"Easy to put in feet. Comfortable. Everyday casual shoes.My husband normally wears size 14 Extra  wide shoes. We purchased size 15. The fit good, not tight."
Skechers,2024-04-07,"Yes they are great for walking and easy to get on and off. That being said if you do plan on walking in them a lot I recommend getting a half size down because they do stretch out after the first few miles of walking. After that they hold shape and are great for 8ish months of every day walking depending on distance and personal build.  If you want these for casual wear then go ahead and give them a healthy coat of water proofing spray and they will last forever. Not for running you will trip and fall. I have had silver, tan, and olive looking colors and they coordinate well with your clothes. O Yea"
Skechers,2024-03-24,"nothing to dislike . product is good , light and confortable all day long"
Skechers,2024-03-23,"Good fit, sturdy & strong. Extremely lightweight Hardly know they  are on."
Skechers,2024-02-24,"This shoe is similar to the Skechers Go Max walking shoe I have already reviewed.  Similar fabric top with an attractive sheen.  The outer sole seems thicker and built more like an athletic sneaker.  The inner sole provides support in cushiony comfort.  The shoes flex nicely, and my feet do not feel pinched nor encased in a  hard shoe.  Another big plus is they are cold water machine washable and then leave out to air dry.  Honestly, these shoes are attractive and I would not mind wearing them when going out to dinner.  Almost forgot, they come in a variety of neutral shades.  And yes, I highly recommend these shoes!"
Skechers,2024-04-13,"Shoes arrived two day early! Wasn't sure what to expect because the reviews were somewhat mixed but after trying them on for the first time, I was impressed on how stylish they looked and how easy they slipped on. The fit was just right and they felt snug and secure not overly tight. They are definitely light weight and they feel as though they breath nicely so if you take a walk, your feet won't feel like they're over heating. I ordered the ""wide fit"" because I need a bit more room at the sides, so these fit well and were comfortable throughout the day. No need to ""cut the strings"" as another viewer suggested. They were designed well to accommodate most people if you choose the fit you actually need. It's nice to be able to slip the shoes on and off with ease as I am at an age where bending over is not as easy as it used to be. But I suppose it doesn't matter how old you are, these Skechers slip-ons are great for any age if only for convenience. Highly recommend!"
Skechers,2024-04-02,"Extremely comfortable shoes.  Exact to listed size.  Easy to slip on. Look to be well made, time will tell.  As long as they turn out to be durable I would buy again."
Skechers,2024-02-29,"A huge plus of course is not needing to pull these on and just slipping into them.. Great at an Airport or just on the go, takes seconds. Comfort is very good, very light weight, I am a heavy walker not sure how these or going to feel after a few miles under them, time will tell.A Plus feature if you have narrow feet get the regulars and if you need to you can cut the laces and use them to get the desired comfort, tie them off and they fit like a glove now and still able to slip them on and off with zero effort, even when I did this. Loved them so much ordered two pairs, one around the house but I recommend Oofo's for that as well, they are the best if you have Plantar fasciitis.Pros:Very ComfortableDo what they say, slip on with easyNot bad lookingLight weightGreat for short walks so far, haven't tried longer than 2 miles.Perfect for travel, easy to removeCan be adjusted if you have narrow feet ""using laces"". Tying them and still be able to slip them on for a more comfortable fit.Cons:Seemed wider than what I am used to for a regular width.Durability ""Unsure"" about this oneLong term comfort ""Unsure""Thicker Shoe heal for more stability!"
Skechers,2024-03-13,"These shoes are great! Comfy, easy Mr Rogers slip on, and look good! But don’t try to sneak up on anybody as every step with my left shoe sounds like I’m stepping on crumpled cellophane. Don’t know if it’s just my pair or all of them that do this but cat burglars need to avoid these."
Skechers,2024-03-29,"I bought my first pair of these Slip Ins when I was going in for surgery and wouldn't be able to tie shoes for a few weeks. I loved that pair so much, I bought this pair and have been wearing them every day ever since...between both pairs, this is almost two years of wearing them constantly and I am a huge fan. Comfortable, slip on without any issues at all, stays on, are super light, affordable, and what else can you ask for? Thumbs up from me."
Skechers,2024-03-26,"Very nice,very light, super comfortable. True to size.These skechers are good quality I wanted to purchase again but unfortunately they run out.Happy with these shoes"
Skechers,2024-04-03,They're light extremely comfortable very easy to get on and off hands down gotta be the best shoe I've ever worn in 57 years they're so good I bought my 77-year-old father appear because it's easier for him to get on and off also these shoes are incredible I will be buying more of them when need be.
Skechers,2024-04-02,Love the slip in feature. I have nerve damage in one leg and it is painful to put on lace up shoes. These are effortless. Nice colors and style too.
Skechers,2024-04-06,"Very comfy out of the box. Nice style, can be worn with jeans, khakis or shorts. Fit is true to size."
Skechers,2024-03-24,"These shoes were much better than I expected.  Comfort, style and durability were second to none.  I am thoroughly enjoying these shoes."
Skechers,2023-11-10,Very comfortable. They are a bit wide but that’s okay for my feet. Look nice dressed up or casual.
Skechers,2024-04-04,"My daughter said “great shoes, trendy and age appropriate”.  These are my new favorites and I typically buy more expensive shoes.  These go with everything and look good with jeans as well as business casual.  I’ll buy them again."
Skechers,2024-04-09,"I got these shoes as a birthday present for my husband, and he just loves them. They look super cute on him, very flattering and go well with both casual and elegant outfits. He says they're also super comfortable and wants to get them in other colors too. Great purchase if you're looking for stylish vegan sneakers."
Skechers,2024-03-20,"Love these shoes, perfect fit & so comfortable, look good too"
Skechers,2023-10-20,"Ordered the 11.5 W. Build quality, comfy insole, and width were all good. Length felt off and was noticeable longer than my other shoes that are all 11.5 Wides. Too hesitant to try to order a smaller size.Recieved the box from Peltz shoes. It comes with detailed instructions on how to process the return. Felt like they were going to reject it so took lots of pictures before shipping with UPS through Amazon Return process. Delivered in Oct. 18th and return started Oct. 19th so let's see."
Skechers,2023-09-21,"We tried out several shoes this summer for my son and this was the winner. Great shoe for the money. He doesn't have a wide foot but he needs a wider toe box, this shoe worked great. Comfortable and stylish as well as affordable. easy to pack in his luggage and worked with many different types of outfits. This was a great find for him!"
Skechers,2024-02-25,"The extra wide width, well designed shape of and comfortable materials used for cushioning, along with the breathable and attractive looking uppers make this an exceptionally nice shoe especially for wearing all day in clean & dry environments.  For example i use mine mainly as slippers /house shoes however they're great casual wear for walking on smooth & dry or carpeted floors or dry paved surfaces just about anywhere."
Skechers,2021-01-17,"OVERVIEWI found these Skechers Avilo loafers to be quite comfortable, an accurate fit, and an overall great everyday shoe.  Hit the mark on the first buy.  I  didn’t have to make multiple attempts to get the 11.5 US size.  No messing around with delays for exchanges or returns - I appreciate that.  The ratings are representative of the shoe.  I reviewed many of the lower and higher ratings - and I will say I side with the higher ratings.AESTHETICSThe fabric color and texture looks just like the picture, but better. The color name “black” seems off - more like grey to me in the picture - and that holds true to actually receiving it.  I am okay with that.  The color shown in the picture is the actual representation.DURABILITYThe elastic holds the shoe on well for everyday things.  For example, worked outside on moderately grass sloped yard doing yard work for an entire day.  Trimmed trees, hauled branches, walked up and down dried grassy slopes.  Walked on decomposed granite - no rocks stuck in my shoes.  Walked across semi-muddy clay areas without great problem. The shoe did not slip off, not even partially.TRACTIONThe sole worked fine for traction.  Wore them over wet concrete, wet vinyl floor, no slipping.  Wore them on fresh light snow day - no issues.  Didn’t try them on wet glossy tile.  (I will post an update when that happens).  Overall these seem to be rather easy to use.COMFORTFor me, I would like a bit more arch support.  If you tend to pronate (roll-in) the you may want an insert for increased comfort.  But I don’t intend to stand all day on hard surfaces so it really doesn’t matter.  Still comfortable.  They are lightweight and not noticeable while wearing.  They did NOT have an incident of slipping off, sliding off, flopping on the heel.CONVENIENCELove the ease of being able to slip the shoes on without untying and retying just to go do some quick tasks (like take the trash out, mailbox walk).  These have become a part of my everyday life.VALUEThese are a good value.  You get a good shoe for the price.  The quality is there and what you expect from Skechers.  Thumbs up.REVIEWThis review is not compensated in any way, shape, or form.  No freebies."
Skechers,2024-03-10,"They look a little smaller/narrower than my other Skechers loafers, but they fit the same (meaning they fit well).  No heel-slip, no crushing of the toes.  The arch support is a bit flatter than I prefer, but not at all bad.  The build quality for mine are pretty good so far.  I haven't worn them enough to get an idea of wear-and-tear."
Skechers,2024-04-09,"So silly me ran a chainsaw over my bare feet and needed stitches. I was travelling 10 days after ""the incident"" and was worried I would have to be wearing sandals all the time. Nearing the departure time I decided to try the slip-ons just to see if any would be comfortable. SO after the goldilocks experiment I found these to be perfect. roomy enough so that the shoe wasn't resting or rubbing on the wound and having the right length that the shoe wasn't falling off. Like I said - perfect fit. Cinderella or Goldilocks - take your pick. All I know is that Sketchers has a fan for life. Oh yeah, The shoes even as it was enclosed around the toe was more comfortable than the sandals I carried. Yayyy"
Skechers,2023-10-22,"I recently purchased the Expected - Avillo casual slip-on sneaker from SKECHERS® for my husband, and it's safe to say he's absolutely smitten with them! Right off the bat, the design speaks volumes about the brand's dedication to marrying style with comfort. The canvas fabric not only brings durability to the table but also showcases a refined, sanded finish that instantly elevates its look.The Relaxed Fit® design is truly the star of the show. My husband has always struggled with finding shoes that accommodate his feet comfortably, but these sneakers, with their generous silhouette, have proven to be a godsend. The added side goring ensures a snug fit, eliminating the age-old issue of shoes slipping off.What he particularly raves about is the Memory Foam insole. He's on his feet a lot during the day, and these provide unparalleled comfort, making it feel like he's walking on clouds. The shock-absorbing midsole paired with the durable rubber outsole offers stability and superior traction, ensuring each step is secure and comfortable.In terms of aesthetics, the contrast stitching detail adds a touch of sophistication to the sneakers, making them versatile enough for both casual outings and semi-formal events. The ventilated environment, thanks to the soft man-made lining, ensures his feet stay fresh, even after long hours of wear.Coming from Skechers, a brand renowned for its dedication to quality and trend-focused designs, I wasn't surprised by the sheer excellence of the Expected - Avillo sneakers. If you're on the hunt for footwear that doesn't compromise on comfort or style, these are a must-have. From utility boots to lifestyle footwear, Skechers' journey has been commendable, and this product just adds another feather to their cap!A big thumbs up for these sneakers! Whether it's a gift for a loved one or a treat for yourself, you can't go wrong with this choice. Highly recommended! 👟🌟"
Skechers,2024-04-05,"It's amazingly comfy and a great fit, one of the best shoes I ever had. Highly recommended"
Skechers,2024-02-16,"I had an good experience with the Sketchers Slip-On's. The loafers are incredibly comfortable, providing ample support throughout the day. I like their stylish design and how easily they were to slip on and off. The quality is great, and I found them to be very durable for everyday wear. Overall, I recommend these loafers for anyone seeking both comfort and style."
Skechers,2024-04-01,"I was searching for a casual shoe that looks nice.The shoes are amazing, xtra wide, feet perfect.Very comfortable for walking and looks great with long pants or dark jeansThe good part if that they are very cheap compared to other brands"
Skechers,2024-03-24,I was very surprised how great of a buy these were. I chose 10.5 size in wide and they fit perfectly. I’d recommend dropping a half size and if you have a thick foot go with the wide sizes as they seem to run small.  These look and feel great!
Skechers,2024-01-28,Bought these for my son who works out in wet weather.  They were not slippery and very comfortable.  True to size.
Skechers,2024-04-10,"These shoes are a true nonslip, super durable waterproof shoe that really works well in the kitchen. The black is super sharp!"
Skechers,2024-04-15,"Received my shoe order yesterday, so far I am very pleased with the fit and comfort.  Even new, they slip on with ease."
Skechers,2023-09-06,"These are in fact slip resistant, they look professional enough, and their easy to clean. But as somebody who has finicky feet my feet are sore after every day at work, which is 8 hours mostly on my feet. The memory foam squishes down to nothing and brings your feet against a very hard bottom of the shoe.I'm going to replace these with better shoes as soon as I can."
Skechers,2024-04-13,I work 12 hr nursing shifts. This is my second pair. Very comfortable and easy to keep clean.
Skechers,2024-04-06,Skechers are pretty darn good shoes. My last pair lasted 5 years and with my weight running a busy kitchen these slip on slip resistant shoes felt great day one. It’s hard for me to find a comfortable work shoe being flat footed and after spending hundreds on shoes for crews I decided to give these a try. These felt great day one but I think this shoe may run a little small. I wear a 11.5 wide and bought a 12 wide and feel a little cramped. I believe once their broken in they will be just about right and for the price feel way better than the twice the price shoes for crews.
Skechers,2024-03-26,"I have wide feet and have struggled to find a good, reliable work shoe that was comfortable and effective. I wore Keen work shoes for many years which I liked, though there was always an uncomfortable break-in period with them. I decided to give these a try and I'm so glad I did! There was no break-in period at all. Comfortable right out of the box. I've been wearing them for several months now and they're holding up well and still very comfortable. I couldn't be happier with them. Plus at such a great price!"
Skechers,2024-03-28,"Very confortable, sturdy product lTight Fit, which is what I require.Just don't try to sneak up on anyone, they squeek (just a little)."
Skechers,2024-03-27,"I used them 24 to 30 hours every week for my fast food job and they were able to hold up for 8 months. They’re comfortable and have good room; never caused any pain standing all day. It is non slip but you still have to be careful because they could be a bit more grippy. After 8 months, the left shoe bottom has separated"
Skechers,2024-04-02,"I am a longtime user of Sketcher shoes, years! This time however, my high school aged son who is now working at Dairy Queen, needed a pair of good working shoes, that will hold up against slippery floors, water and ice cream falling on them. He told me that these were the most comfortabl shoes he has ever had, and not up against his athletic shoes, but any shoe he has ever worn. I like to think I just made him a Sketcher fan for life, just like I am."
Skechers,2024-01-10,"I do dishwashing / prep for a living and these are essential. I would never walk into a dishroom or kitchen without special nonslip work shoes ever again. Don't try to get away with ""black soled"" shoes or whatever is in your closet. These even kind of look cool in a ""I don't care what I'm wearing"" kind of way. I wear them all the time. The non slip hasn't worn out either. I walk to work in them and to the grocery store, etc. I've had them about 6 months of regular use and they are holding up, sole hasn't come off. I think I bought some gel inserts though. I guess I forgot about that. I would definitely buy gel inserts if you can."
Skechers,2024-03-23,Nice comfortable shoe
Skechers,2024-02-23,"I ordered 14 regular shoes. They fit ok lengthwise,  but they were very wide.  They looked liked wide shoes.  Ugly and looked like they were the footwear of someone substantially heavier than me."
Skechers,2024-04-04,These work shoes always hold up well and are very comfortable I work on a concrete floor 8 hours a day
Skechers,2024-04-16,Skechers is usually my go to for sneakers. I purchased these for an upcoming trip to Ireland & Scotland. I've only wore them around the house at this point but they are very comfortable and I believe they'll hold up well to the 18 rounds in their future.
Skechers,2024-04-16,Good support and a good fit
Skechers,2024-01-18,"Great look, great fit and one of the most comfortable pair of shoes I've ever had!"
Skechers,2024-02-07,Very comfortable shoes and size 10 is a perfect fit
Skechers,2023-12-20,Very happy with quality and comfort
Skechers,2023-05-06,Would like Sketchers to start making this shoe available in US.  Great shoe and comfortable.  I have had maybe 4 pairs over several years and certainly would order this shoe again if they did not ship only from UK as my last order got lost.  I did get a refund and Amazon people were very helpful
Skechers,2021-04-01,"Light and airy moc-proto-sneaker and walking shoe. The ""California Rake"" (ramps up from front to rear) in the sole/heel layer put your balance just a small fraction forward giving one the odd feeling to get going and walk or even run. LoL.  I bought these to replace my last pair which I was most happy with, but the reputable and venerable old major supplier of the genre kept the name of the model but changed it considerably to where it was unrecognizable. This Sketchers Boat shoe comes the closest to that which I'm trying to replace. I read a review or two where the buyer mentioned having a choice of widths. This current seller gave no such choice of widths.  Had I a choice, I would have gone up a width size for a canvas shoe as I have a wide foot. Though most size 10's fit well, I sometimes have to go up a width size. it all depends on the manufacturer's guarded ""lasts"". But these felt so nice, I couldn't let them go back on the truck. If I find a wider pair from this mfr, I'll buy them too! LoL.  Either way, they fit 95% perfect on a quick mail order and I was finally able to replace my old last 2 pairs of boat shoes. I've been wearing boat shoes every year when I'm on my own time for the past half century. I highly recommend this leisure shoe, though I can't vouch for usage on a boat since I havn't been on one in the past few years. I was on fishing boats all summer in my younger yrs and these shoes certainly feel like I'd have given them a try wiith confidence!"
Skechers,2023-09-15,"comfortable,light casual shoe  could use a little more arch support, Good price point/quality"
Skechers,2023-12-28,Loved color and fit
Skechers,2023-09-12,Sketchers are the most comfortable shoes by far. These are so great to wear around the marina and at the boat. I love the casual look and the comfort. Sketchers are always a winner.
Skechers,2024-03-23,"I have wide feet and have always had a hard time finding comfortable shoes. And now, my feet are not only wide but bony and arthritic.  So I figured I'd try the Skechers and I'm both shocked and pleasantly so. The size and width are as described.  Equally important is that they are very well padded, reduce the pressure on the bony protuberances and they are truly comfortable. I can recommend these shoes/sneakers to all with wide feet including folks who require a padding for their feet. They also seem well-made and time will tell. But a great value for the price ."
Skechers,2024-03-17,"These Sketchers are nice and keep their appearance. Comfortable for walking long distances and nice enough for a night out. Great for travel, too."
Skechers,2023-12-29,"I was looking for a casual shoe to wear with jeans and shorts - around the house or on weekends.  The Sketchers are definitely easy to put on - just slide in, the heels are stiff enough that they don't get mashed by my heels. The soles and insoles are comfortable and supportive.  The uppers are a little loose but not too bad - probably necessary for the slip-on style.  They're great for driving long distances.  I'm not really thrilled with the way they look when I'm wearing them.  Not sure how much I'll wear them in public."
Skechers,2024-04-04,these are by far the best sneakers Ive ever whore there so lite and comfortable and true to size
Skechers,2024-03-10,I bought these before a three month trip to Europe.  Very comfy and fairly durable on the streets of the Old World.  They passed as my dress shoes a couple of times too.
Skechers,2024-04-15,"Title says it all,  Very comfortable, easy on, easy off, look sharp."
Skechers,2024-04-15,"I found these to be quite comfortable, easy to put on and good-looking shoes. Unfortunately, the mesh in the toe box is not very durable and before too long, my big toe wore a hole through the mesh. There seems to be a ""wear"" layer inside the mesh, but it doesn't come up far enough to protect more of the mesh where my toe poked through. First pair of shoes I've had where the tops wore out before the soles. Wish the design was a bit different."
Skechers,2024-04-13,Very comfortable easy to walk in unfortunately a little big but that’s my fault. Just wear two pairs of socks with them.
Skechers,2023-08-01,"I've been looking for golf shoes for quite some time and I recently wore a pair of Skechers sneakers and the comfort was fantastic. I was hoping this comfort would translate to their golf shoes and these did not disappoint! The shoe itself is very good looking with the white water resistant top and the purple sole and interior. A really good looking golf shoe. The comfort is truly insane and to date, the best golf shoe I have ever owned and I have owned some very expensive shoes over the 20+ years of golfing. Just keep in mind that these are water repellent and not water proof when purchasing, which might make a difference for those who golf year round. I live in the Northeast and I'm not golfing year round so I cannot speak to how well they will hold up but they seem pretty solid thus far. Honestly, I believe you will be quite pleased with these shoes and the price is very good for the comfort and quality you are getting. Truly a great purchase!"
Skechers,2024-03-26,Very comfortable and true to size!Wore them  with no problems and walked the course no need to break them in!
Skechers,2024-02-20,They are very good looking … and so comfortable and so reasonably priced !
Skechers,2023-12-10,"These golf shoes are so comfortable! I really enjoy wearing them.  I wear an arch support in them and they still fit fine.The only thing I don’t like is that the soles, although gripping well, do pick up dead leaves & debris and require cleaning after a game. That’s why I scored them as a 4."
Skechers,2024-02-19,Very comfortable and true to size.  I bought the 7 wide and they fit perfectly.
Skechers,2024-04-03,Comfort and long lasting!
Skechers,2024-03-16,Like the color and good grip soles !
Skechers,2023-10-11,"This is the second pair of these golf shoes I bought. I thought the first pair were just poorly constructed, the tops cracked and separated after a short time. I thought I would try them again because there are comfortable, I bought them only a few months ago and they fell apart! Of course the return date is only 30 days so I am unable to get a refund. DO NOT BUY THESE SHOES OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE SECONDS AND NOT MADE WELL!"
Skechers,2024-04-14,The shoes are so perfect... feet do not hurt after one or two rounds in the same day!! Perfect!!
Skechers,2024-04-15,I bought these shoes because I feel the mesh is very comfortable
Skechers,2024-04-14,Muy buen artículo!
Skechers,2024-03-22,Fit good and comfortable!  Golf
Skechers,2024-03-31,"Good price,  comfortable shoe, probably will order another pair to keep on shelf."
Skechers,2024-04-05,Great fit - half sizes were irrelevant?
Skechers,2024-04-05,Comfortable and well priced
Skechers,2024-04-01,Nice comfortable golf shoes
Skechers,2024-03-18,"I bought them for my wife and she loves them. Great fit, nice looking, and comfortable."
Skechers,2024-02-28,These are light weight and super comfortable. I take out the inserts and put in my own for more support. These are casual and look nice with everything. They also work if you have to do some walking. I only wish the bottom was more slip resistant. These are so lightweight they can also be used for house shoes. Not an overly supportive shoe but nice for the house or casual wear.
Skechers,2024-03-12,I use these for regular walking and work. The comfort is wonderful and allows for arch support if needed. True fit!
Skechers,2024-03-15,"This pair of Skecher boat shoes is very light partly because it is not made of leather and is machine washable.  It is soft, light and comfortable.  It is half the price of the ones that are made of leather.  Hopefully, it is just as durable.I have never bought Skecher brand!  Much to my surprise, it is as comfortable as Sperry.Jury is still out on whether it is as durable.  It remains to be seen."
Skechers,2024-01-29,"My wife loves this shoe.  It's very light weight and comfortable.  There's not much in the support area, but works well for its purpose."
Skechers,2024-03-24,I was ready for a shoe with a little more style than a simple slip-on.  The fit is perfect.
Skechers,2024-03-21,"These shoes fit perfectly.  I wore them all day the first day, no breaking in time needed.  They are so comfortable.  Great shoe"
Skechers,2024-04-15,I am a perfect sized 7Wide. Skechers site rarely has the ones I want. I'm so happy to find more wide width shoes here on Amazon. These are so comfortable and lightweight. I want to get the tan ones also. The navy blue was my first choice.
Skechers,2024-03-11,"I bought it to try since the price was affordable for a stylish golf shoe and it was water resistant.Haven’t gotten to test out water resistance with heavy moisture but my foot stayed dry in light rains so far.The shoe is comfortable and padded well. I also like the spikeless pattern on the sole. There’s enough grip to stay grounded on the swing but nothing too destructive to punch up the greens as you measure that 3 foot putt you’re going to miss.Great shoe, great value."
Skechers,2024-03-18,"These golf shoes fit well and, since I ordered the WIDE size, they are extremely comfortable on my wide feet.  I highly recommend them."
Skechers,2024-03-31,I wanted a pair of white comfortable golf shoes in these were perfect I'm only giving it four stars though because I'll probably just get 2 years most out of them but you can't beat the price and the comfortability and the looks they look great
Skechers,2024-01-01,"I come from the old school- I grew up with metal spikes. I eventually embraced the soft spikes, but only on shoes that they could be replaced. This is my first pair of shoes without replaceable spikes, and I am easing into the idea. I do love the light weight of these for sure. I'm wary of the water resistance. I previously couldn't afford more than one pair of shoes, but now I can have a couple of pairs in the rotation. My thought is to wear these on warm days when the course is dry, and if conditions are wetter I would go to another pair that is more waterproof. I am not sure about the durability of the traction ""spikes"", but these are a lower cost alternative to shoes with replaceable spikes.So far I'm pleased and will continue to evaluate, these appear to be a good addition to the arsenal."
Skechers,2024-03-20,Incredibly comfortable and look good.
Skechers,2024-04-08,it's a good product at a great price.  Nothing to complain about it.
Skechers,2024-03-09,Very comfortable golf shoes. Will buy another if the price is right.
Skechers,2024-03-06,"I ordered 9.5,  not 9.5 extra wide!  I really like the looks of the shoe and the stable tread but the size comes larger than the stated size.  Although a 9.5, the shoe is really closer to a 10.  I was disappointed to see the extra wide size because I have a narrow foot.  I tend to slew around in these on the golf course. If they had come as I ordered, the shoe would be very comfortable and stable."
Skechers,2024-03-15,i have slender feet and ordered a half size bigger and they fit perfectly. they look like docs but are actually comfortable. the only con is they get stained really easy
Skechers,2024-04-10,This oxford may look heavy but it's actually very light. They run true to size. I wear a size 9. I didn't have to break them in like another brand I tried. The toe box is also very roomy.
Skechers,2024-03-23,"These are the best shoes I've ever worn. Had 2 knees done I needed something for support standing long hours. My feet did not hurt, no back aches. I would definitely recommend"
Skechers,2024-02-23,"Absolutely love the style, materials and coloring of this shoe. However, I can’t wear them all day as they hurt my feet. I initially purchased them for work since I’m on my feet a lot but have since made them more of a shoe for my days off."
Skechers,2024-02-29,"I ended buying these because I got a pair secondhand turned out to be quite old and started stripping on first wear.  Bought them again because the fit of these is really great-  design-wise, they're not far off from the oxford style of Docs, which I love.  Despite owning several pairs of those, I still appreciate these, since they have a wider toe box, are more geared towards comfort than longevity, and they've actually got half sizes, which means that you can get a really good fit."
Skechers,2023-11-01,Bought my size (8) but had to return them for .5 a size smaller (7.5) & those fit great. The toe part is very spacious which is why you sometimes have to size down. They’re sturdy and so cute to style! Going to be wearing these all fall.
Skechers,2024-02-04,"I have foot and back problems! These are wonderful. Not heavy. Good arch support. My back doest hurt as much when I've worn these all day, and that's saying a lot! Highly recommend!"
Skechers,2024-03-22,"These appear to be made well, but I find them very uncomfortable.  I don't feel like there is arch support.  They are very firm and stiff.  I wore them several times thinking I could break them in so I can't return them.  I wish I had just returned them the first time I put them on."
Skechers,2024-02-01,"Usually wear a Size US 9 and/or EU 40 fairly reliably. Ordered the Skechers Slip-in in a Size 9. Too small! Pinched my forefoot in the toebox area, and squished my big toenail on each foot. No go. Returned that shoe. (Thank you, Whole Foods drop off!) Ordered a Size 9 Wide. Too big! My foot slid around inside the shoe while walking, and the shoe slid off the top of my heel at the back of my foot. Ok, then. Exchanged that shoe with a Size 8.5 Wide. JUST RIGHT! Omg, y’all. Finally, a solid fit! Just enough room in the toebox for my forefoot to spread out, and a sturdy, steady grip at the heel. Great arch support, and heel cushioning, too. A really comfortable, easy-wearing shoe for every day running around. 🙂👍"
Skechers,2024-02-27,"OMG is exactly what i said the first time i slipped on this shoe. So easy to step in to,  fit perfectly,  doesn't look clunky.  I have had back issues for about a year,  and putting on shoes was something I dreaded because it almost always caused my back to hurt.  But no more! I have done my neighborhood walk,  and spent most of today in them doing various activities out and about,  and my feet feel great!  I have always loved Skechers, and this slip on version is like heaven for my feet.  If you are thinking about getting slip on shoes,  I highly recommend these."
Skechers,2024-03-08,Bought these for my  88 year old mother.She is thrilled with how easy she can get her shoes on without help!!!! She states how she just steps right into them and getting off is just as easyShe also loves the material and how they feel on her feet and they look great too!!
Skechers,2024-04-08,"Love the color, the ease of slipping them on and off, the support and they’re cute."
Skechers,2024-03-28,"I recently purchased the Skechers Women's Hands-Free Slip Ins Ultra Flex 3.0 Smooth Step Sneaker, and I couldn't be happier! Let me share why these sneakers have become my new favorites:👉 Effortless Style: These slip-ons' sleek design immediately caught my eye.

Skechers,2024-02-16,"You will want to buy these shoes! From my first step I felt like I was walking in slippers! Divine. Truly step in as advertised. True to size. The shoes do not slip or slide at all, due to the way they have been made."
Skechers,2024-03-24,"Very comfortable, supportive, attractive and they slide on and off easily."
Skechers,2024-04-04,"My wife really likes these, she said for her they are easy to slip on without having to bend down, and very comfortable. She thought the price was a bit high, but worth it in the long run."
Skechers,2024-02-22,Great price on these shoes. Great shoe if your are looking for something to upgrade too. True to size and comfy as heck.
Skechers,2024-03-09,"I have always LOOKED at Skeechers but never bought them, Always the Nike or Addidas. Wellnever again, this is THE most comfortable shoe and the spikeless bottom is anything but that!Unreal traction and did I mention comfortable!? Supper light and they come in wide sizes, thankyour very much for that.  So yeah buy some Skeechers, because they aint skeechey!"
Skechers,2024-03-28,Hubby loves these shoes.  They fit right out of the box and he says they are really comfortable and the color is perfect.  He got the grey size 10.  He has already recommended then to other golfers as they noticed right away he had these neat new golf shoes
Skechers,2023-12-16,"I like the sketchers golf shoe product. This is the third pair of golf shoes I have purchased. This last pair was a different model from the first two.Overall, a nice fit. A little heavier feel than the other ones I bought. Good grip, haven't felt my feet slip out at all.The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because they don't breathe well. My feet don't usually sweat but they do in these shoes."
Skechers,2024-03-21,"Great sneakers, good price, well made comfortable, makes my golf game better"
Skechers,2024-04-01,They fit well and were very comfortable playing several rounds.  My feet didn’t hurt at all.  Highly recommended!!
Skechers,2024-03-07,Love my first use of my Sketchers golf shoes! The durable short spikes are stable and secured my footing! Comfortable fitting with a tennis shoe style comfort.
Skechers,2024-03-20,"Good looking, very comfortable and easy on your feet."
Skechers,2024-02-19,"These arrived in a very timely fashion. They were comfortable from the get go. My feet slid into them, hands free, with no trouble.  They're very attractive. They're machine washable! I'm totally pleased.  So much so that I  ordered a pair of Skechers hands free in black to wear during winter weather.  They arrived today.  They are very comfortable, good looking and my feet slid into them, hands free, with no problem. This pair, too, is machine washable."
Skechers,2024-03-24,"Just what I wanted! Fit is perfect, comfortable. I will be getting another or in different color!"
Skechers,2024-03-26,"Love that they are slip ons, look adorable with jeans!"
Skechers,2024-04-11,"I’m a size 6 in shoes. I got these in my normal size, and they feel tight. Not painful, but not comfortable at all. I love them though, so I guess I’ll be returning them for a 6.5"
Skechers,2024-03-21,These are wonderful just slip in and go. I look nice with blue jeans. They’re very comfortable. Just love them.
Skechers,2024-03-15,"I love this step-in feature.  It makes putting on shoes so easy.  I’ve purchased two pair for a granddaughter & one pair for myself.  The sizing is generous. So a half size down might be advised.  There is not much of an arch support, which is fine for me, but be warned.  I find them very comfortable & I’m happily wearing them every day."
Skechers,2024-03-08,"These shoes are the bomb!  Cute, comfortable and the fit was spot on!!  I love my new summer Skechers."
Skechers,2024-04-16,"Very strange-they slipped on easily, but literally pinched my small toes on both feet so badly my toes would go numb. They were cute, but not comfortable at all."
Skechers,2024-04-11,"Fits perfectly, very lightweight but sturdy and very comfortable"
Skechers,2024-04-09,They are so nice.  They fit my feet well and are so comfortable to walk in.  Easy to slip into.  Will be ordering not color in this style!
Skechers,2024-04-05,"I love everything about this shoe.  Comfy spongie insole, easy on, easy off.  I have had hip surgery and tying shoes or doing anything around my feet is difficult.  These shoes are making my life so much easier.  Attractive, light, cool, well padded.  Very happy feet!"
Skechers,2024-03-06,These shoes are very lightweight and comfortable. Nice material too.  I normally wear a wide shoe but these seem a bit loose and do not feel like a good sturdy shoe. Too much give for me.  So will be returning.
Skechers,2024-04-06,"These shoes are a perfect fit and are SO comfortable!  I appreciate this Seller offering shoes where we can choose the width size of the shoe.  Not many Sellers do this and I won't buy from any Seller who will not offer a width size.  The shoes are gorgeous, dark blue with white soles.  I love them and highly recommend this Seller."
Skechers,2024-03-28,I wear Sketcher brand walking shoes almost daily and find them to be very comfortable and supportive. These slip-ins are equally as comfortable and the price is better than I can find at our local outlet.  True to size.
Skechers,2024-04-11,I can't say enough about these comfortable shoes. I have neuropathy and it's hard for me to find a shoe that's comfortable. I looked high and low and finally ran across these and I read the reviews. They are so comfortable I could wear them all day. And they are pretty. This is navy blue I want to get a few more pair in different colors. In other tennis shoes like Nikes I wear a nine but in Skechers I wear my size 8 1/2. I actually ordered a 9 and a 8 1/2 just to make sure that one of them fit. The 8  1/2 fit perfect. They look so nice with my blue jeans I mainly wear them to doctor's appointments hair appointments stuff like that. I don't wear these for my long walking which you could but I need just a little bit more support in the ankle. I definitely give them five stars. And I highly recommend them.
Skechers,2024-04-15,"I bought these for an upcoming trip to London because of the number of positive reviews, and I wore them for about 2 weeks prior to our trip just to make sure they were what I wanted (I'm a school teacher and do a fair bit of walking everyday).  They're great!  Comfortable, easy to put on and take off, very little slippage, and very light weight.  Also, cute!!!  I was so excited, I bought two more pairs in other colors.Cue to our very recent trip to London.  7 days of sightseeing, using the tubes to get where we needed.  By Day 2, I had a tiny blister on the ball of my foot.  Figured it was because of increased walking, but okay.  By the end of Day 3, that blister was a bit larger and a new formed on the side of my heel.  By Day 4, I had a third blister on my other heel, and I was forced to drain the first blister because I could barely walk.  By Day 5, all the blisters were bigger (the one I had drained had developed new ones around it), I was trying to drain the remaining two.  By Day 6-7, the pain was near-unbearable.  I had been using blister patches for days, but still.  Things were made worse with our trip home when one of the patches slipped off and got wedged under my toes and rubbing that area raw.  Being in the airport and airplane, there was no real space for me to take off my shoes to air out my feet and blisters.  I got home last night, and the drained blisters had crusted over and refilled, one with blood.So while these shoes may be now a decent choice for light daily walking, I cannot recommend them for intense, vigorous walking."
Skechers,2024-02-19,"First off, my husband is a one pair of shoes at a time guy. He buys a pair and wears them to work, church, going out, you name it. Unless it calls for a winter boot or a dress shoe. He’s wearing a version of these sketchers. With daily use these hold up great! We get about 6 months out of each pair and simply order a new one. He started with the grey ones, then the beige, now the all black. We’ve liked all the colors, they all go well with a variety of his wardrobe. I’d say the grey are the most versatile.Hes on his feet all day and never complains of pain or discomfort with these. And I love that they can be easily slipped off when when he enters the house!The fit is standard and shipping is quick, through the different colors the sizes have been consistent as well!I see a lot of men in these and overall they look good and are really functional!Highly suggest!"
Skechers,2024-03-02,These were a great choice.  Normally I need to try on shoes in person but these were a great fit.  They are stylish and very comfortable.
Skechers,2024-04-02,"We own these shoes in multiple colors. They are great for anyone that is on their feet all the time. Lots of support, true to size, and stylish can we worn dressed up or just casually."
Skechers,2024-03-01,I have purchased this same pair three times over. They look good with almost any outfit and are extremely comfortable.My only gripe is I’ve had to purchase these multiple times because Skechers aren’t very durable. The insole falls apart after 6 months and the tread will go bald. I’ll still buy another pair after these fall apart.
Skechers,2024-02-15,"My son is 14 and is on the Autism spectrum, so he’s incredibly sensitive to shoes & clothing.  He normally only wears crocs shoes but needed a pair of runners for PE class & long distance walking.I love that these shoes are easy to slip on, have a wide option and are super comfortable for him. I literally ordered 6 different types of shoes for him to try on at home, as taking him shoe shopping can be difficult for him. I even ordered a more expensive brand (Kizik) and he ended up choosing these sneakers (half the price) as they were the best fitting for him.The quality and style is awesome, but the fit is hands downs what is the best thing about this style. It has a soft gel type insole that moulds to his foot and he’s able to wear these all day without complaining his feet hurt.If you’re on the fence about buying these, try them! Amazon has an amazing return policy which is why I love shopping here."
Skechers,2024-03-25,"Bought these for some comfortable shoes for throwing in cornhole tournaments. And these shoes are great, so lightweight and comfortable. I ended up getting 2 pairs of these. One pair is a half size over the first pair I got to accommodate a thicker sock if I want it. Love these and they really look good also."
Skechers,2024-04-02,"My husband loves his gray ""dress sneaker"" Skechers, but they're getting a bit worn. So I got him these and he opted for the tan to have something different. They are neat-looking and classy enough for work outfits and restaurants, but also comfortable and plain enough for casual settings. We love the versatility. They also earned a nod of approval and nice compliment from our teen, so apparently they pass as ""non-embarrassing"" as well."
Skechers,2024-02-21,"These are comfortable, light, and supportive, while still being attractive and not frumpy -- plus not expensive.  The holy grail of shoes.  I've bought several colors for my husband because he loves them and wears the heck out of them."
Skechers,2024-04-08,"Love! Roomy for a wide foot. I wear an 11.5 wide. I have walked in them for weeks, and they are comfortable, they breath and they look great. Highly recommend! Will purchase more colors for next fall season."
Skechers,2024-04-13,Very comfortable. Good looking. True to size. I'll be buying more!
Skechers,2024-02-28,The right shoe is too big for me?? but very cute. I might order a smaller size.
Skechers,2024-04-12,Sketchers don't disappoint...very comfortable and fit well...look nice too!
Skechers,2024-03-24,These shoes I bought because I love Sketchers shoes. So comfortable and these looked nice enough to wear to church.They had them in all different colors!No I didn’t go to the Mall to buy them! I ordered them from Amazon because I have ordered many pairs of shoes and really liked the fit! I have never sent any back that didn’t fit.I got a grease spot on the top and put them on a casual cycle on the washer and when they finished drying they looked brand new!Win Win!
Skechers,2024-04-07,Sketchers are my go to shoes. They always fit and last forever! Super comfy and podiatrist recommended years ago. I’ll buy again!!
Skechers,2024-01-10,"I normally wear 9 or 9.5 WW shoes,, which are very hard to find, and when located are expensive.  I was pleased when a friend told me that some women’s Skecher shoes come in wide width and would be wide enough to accommodate my WW foot.  So, I tried these and other Skecher styles.  Yes.  The wides can accommodate a WW foot.  But Skechers makes its wide shoes so wide that the heel slips whenever I walk and I can’t keep them on my feet.  I liked this shoe.  It didn’t have much arch support or cushion, but it was comfortable enough and dressy enough that it looked good with dress slacks.  I tried putting a forefoot cushion into the shoe to push my foot back into the heel.  Nope.  I tried putting a pad into the heel to better grip my foot.  Nope.  I tried both remedies.  Nope.  Couldn’t keep the backs from flipping up and down.  I’m desperate for attractive, comfortable WW or equivalent shoes that fit both the front and back of my foot.  These were returned."
Skechers,2024-03-14,"First pair of sketchers closed toe shoe. True to size though. They seemed a bit tight at first, I wear and 8 but because this shoe a crocheted fabric, I opted to keep them as I know they will stretch a bit. Overall, a great work shoe :) Very happy"
Skechers,2024-03-24,"I have been wearing these for years and they work well for a shop environment,  soft and flexible with good support,  I can't wear a steel toe or work boot type shoe for what I do and I  like these"
Skechers,2024-04-03,Fit as expected and look very good for work sneakers.  Comfortable.
Skechers,2024-01-16,Great shoes for restaurant work. Comfortable.  Not totally slip proof. Haven't slipped but have slid.
Skechers,2023-11-19,"Bought these a year ago they have held up well. Nice fit and comfortable, have walked a lot in these sneakers at work. Buying another pair since the sole bottoms are wearing a bit after a year of use. These are great sneakers for the price."
Skechers,2024-03-04,"For many years I have always purchased the Skechers Felton model...twice a year.  However, this time I couldn't find my size/wide width.  Also, the Felton model is no longer featured on the Skechers website.  I think the Dighton model is the new replacement...because as far as I can tell it is almost identical to the former Felton...just a slight cosmetic update.Update.  After wearing the Dighton for a week in the restaurant I realized that the ""toe box"" is wider.  It is definitely a more comfortable shoe than the Felton.  I think that's the only difference."
Skechers,2024-03-29,"I love these sketches they are good, reliable, work shoes at a great price recommend very highly"
Skechers,2024-01-27,Thought shoes would have lasted longer than 4 months. Bottom of soles held up but outside material on top and sides started peeling off.
Skechers,2024-03-26,"I found these shoes to be very comfortable. Walking constantly on my security patrols I need these comfortable, casual and slip resistant shoes."
Skechers,2023-11-06,I have been for wearing  lace up Skeechers for years but I have a physical problem trying to bend down and tie the laces. It was very difficult for me to put on my shoes. This has now changed. These are breeze to put on.It is as easy as the commercials say. No bending or pushing They are very comfortable and look good. Since I don't have to wear dress shoes any more I guess I have a new way of dressing.  I will probably order another pair in a different color. I highly recommend these.
Skechers,2023-12-31,"Great comfort, good instep cushioning and I have one foot with flat arch..  Slip on easy, size accurate.  Have purchased two pair..  look nice."
Skechers,2024-03-18,"My husband has hard to fit, wide feet.  These fit and were comfortable.  They looked really nice with his jeans.  Much dressier than his usual sneakers but with all of the comfort of sneaker."
Skechers,2024-04-12,"I am enjoying the easy slip on feature. No using a shoe horn anymore. They look great, too!"
Skechers,2024-01-27,"First got a pair of these loafers in my normal size, and Skechers is usually on the money, but this time they were not a good fit. More specifically, the right shoe was too big at the heel, so when I walked around my right heel would pop out. I double checked that both shoes were the same and expected size. Exchanged the pair for the next half size down, and now I have a better fit (although the right shoe is still slightly roomier at the heel than the left, but not enough to be a problem again).Other than the initial fitment problem, the shoes look good, are comfortable for wearing around the house on a daily basis, and, importantly, my feet don't get too hot in them.The full star off in the rating is due to the fitment issue and because of the high price. Not sure these are worth the $80 price tag, but they better at least last a good while."
Skechers,2024-04-11,"Shoe fits well, pleased."
Skechers,2024-02-09,"I bought these for my father, he is 87 and has swollen feet from medication.  He loves the fact he can just step right into them.  Says they are comfortable also.  May buy another pair in a different color."
Skechers,2024-02-23,Excellent shoes.  I had purchased the exact shoe before and they were great and easy to slip in and out. I did unfortunately select a wide size but should have stayed with the regular width. My fault. Sizes run true. Returned them but wouldn’t hesitate to purchase this shoe design in the future.
Skechers,2024-04-16,"These are comfortable, light weight walking shoes, I think a good buy for the money and true to size.  I am walking 2-3 miles a day and  they seem to be holding up well"
Skechers,2023-04-02,The only Shoes I wear.
Skechers,2024-03-23,These Skechers are just really comfortable and a perfect fit. I usually take a size10 in skechers sandals and shoes but find I need a size up for training shoes.  These ate fabulous walking shoes as they offer great support and cushioning for the feet ... I  recommend these trainers ... you won't be disappointed.
Skechers,2022-03-27,Just received these a few days ago. I have only worn them in the house so far due to recent rain.I ordered a half size up and they are really comfortable and lightweight. Traction on sole is also good. Ready to enjoy spring morning walks!
Skechers,2024-03-27,Sketchers never disappoints. Subtle style with a lot of comfort.
Skechers,2023-03-02,Extremely comfortable!
Skechers,2024-03-28,"These walking shoes are very comfortable, but I have to size up! I'm a true 7.5 with medium width feet and ordered these in 7.5 regular. Wearing exercise socks, my toes reached all the way to the end of the shoe and my pinky toes were slightly pressed in. There was no wiggle room at all.I'm going for size 8!"
Skechers,2020-09-23,"This is my second pair of Sketchers Go Walk and they are the most comfortable sneaker.  They are soft, have goodarch support and a solid gripping sole.  I walk 2-3 miles a day and these out-perform any other walking shoe.Fit is true to size.  I highly recommend to any who walk or stand on their feet for hours a day."
Skechers,2024-03-29,"Light, supportive, color perfect, and great price. I definitely want to recommend these!!!!"
Skechers,2024-01-08,"I love that these are very stylish looking, and they are so comfortable on my wide feet! They are very light weight, and easy to pack in a bag. I get a lot of compliments on them. I wear a size 6 and that;s what I ordered and they fit perfect!"
Skechers,2024-03-27,I loved this shoe right out of the box. This is my first pair of Skechers and I am very pleased. I work in an office and these were very comfortable right out the box. I wear 11 wide and the fit was perfect -- no complaints at all. I plan on wearing these for casual Fridays or when I know I'll be doing more field work. I also plan on trying more Skecher styles.
Skechers,2024-03-05,"I got these shoes when I was 30 weeks pregnant because none of my other closed shoes fit anymore. I wanted something versatile, cute, and slip-on. These definitely did the job! They are comfy and supportive. I walked around in them for hours on multiple occasions. They stretched just enough to continue being comfortable as my feet got bigger at the end of my pregnancy, and I still felt cute. I would highly recommend these, especially if you’re a momma-to-be looking for easy, cute, and comfy shoes!"
Skechers,2024-03-21,Lightweight slip on.  I bought these at a Skechers outlet last year and the Amazon ones seem much lighter.  Not sure if they will hold up like the others but I like them because they are stylish and easy to slip on and off.
Skechers,2024-04-01,"Nice summer color, very comfortable and fits true to size"
Skechers,2024-03-18,Shoe is just right. Very soft step. Love them.
Skechers,2024-03-23,I work on a yacht and have to wear boat shoes at work. I ordered a few of these in different colors two years ago. They are so comfortable and easy to slip on and off. I just bought another pair because I love them so much.
Skechers,2023-12-15,"I ordered the Skechers Go Walk Evolution (size 12 normal width) online to replace my Costco-purchased cheaper Skechers Memory Foam pair since they are no longer available at Costco.  I became very fond of those Skechers since they were lightweight, breathed well, and were durable for my two daily walks.  As an old retired guy (since 2005), I need daily exercise to keep my health up.Anyway, the Costco Skechers were a simpler version that I needed a hook to put on as they were a tight fit with thinner sides, but that was the way they were made.  The sides were not rounded as these Skechers Go Walk pair.  These cost a bit more but are well worth it since I can simply slip my feet into them without assistance and just ""go walk"".  They don't fit as tight as the Costco ones but they still fit perfectly on my feet.  No side movement or pinched toes -- I ordered the same size as the Costco pair.  Still very light and breathable.  I will only know about the durability after many walks in them, but they do look like they should last for some time.Side note:  I read a negative review where a person faulted the shoe for the way the shoe tended to grip the walking surface.  I assumed that was an old person. Almost any new shoe will do that but most wearers know this and adjust.  However, we older folks (I'm very old) must be very aware of this with any new shoe because we are already prone to falls since we tend not to pick our feet up as well as younger folks, which is why we often trip and fall.Anyway, these Skechers will grip the surface very well so one will not slip easily on surfaces.  That is a good thing for seniors!  But they will need to be aware that they must pick up their feet to step and walk.  Humans are adaptable so if I can do this at my age, I know other old folks can, too.I would recommend these to anyone who wants a lightweight, comfortable, easy-to-wear slip-on shoe.  I will be ordering these again when the pair I have wears out.  :)"
Skechers,2024-04-03,"I have really picky feet, never buy shoes on line, cause most of the times they don't fit and hurt my abnormally high foot instep. This time it worked like a charm, the shoes a re great and a perfect fit."
Skechers,2024-04-09,"I bought these shoes for work thinking they would just be some shoes that I could beat up and not care about. They are extremely comfortable, very breathable, and I got the wide size which gives my toes plenty of room. I was actually surprised by how nice they look on foot and wouldn’t mind wearing these outside of work with a casual fit."
Skechers,2024-03-29,"Easy to put in feet. Comfortable. Everyday casual shoes.My husband normally wears size 14 Extra  wide shoes. We purchased size 15. The fit good, not tight."
Skechers,2024-04-07,"Yes they are great for walking and easy to get on and off. That being said if you do plan on walking in them a lot I recommend getting a half size down because they do stretch out after the first few miles of walking. After that they hold shape and are great for 8ish months of every day walking depending on distance and personal build.  If you want these for casual wear then go ahead and give them a healthy coat of water proofing spray and they will last forever. Not for running you will trip and fall. I have had silver, tan, and olive looking colors and they coordinate well with your clothes. O Yea"
Skechers,2024-03-24,"nothing to dislike . product is good , light and confortable all day long"
Skechers,2024-03-23,"Good fit, sturdy & strong. Extremely lightweight Hardly know they  are on."
Skechers,2024-02-24,"This shoe is similar to the Skechers Go Max walking shoe I have already reviewed.  Similar fabric top with an attractive sheen.  The outer sole seems thicker and built more like an athletic sneaker.  The inner sole provides support in cushiony comfort.  The shoes flex nicely, and my feet do not feel pinched nor encased in a  hard shoe.  Another big plus is they are cold water machine washable and then leave out to air dry.  Honestly, these shoes are attractive and I would not mind wearing them when going out to dinner.  Almost forgot, they come in a variety of neutral shades.  And yes, I highly recommend these shoes!"
Skechers,2024-04-13,"Shoes arrived two day early! Wasn't sure what to expect because the reviews were somewhat mixed but after trying them on for the first time, I was impressed on how stylish they looked and how easy they slipped on. The fit was just right and they felt snug and secure not overly tight. They are definitely light weight and they feel as though they breath nicely so if you take a walk, your feet won't feel like they're over heating. I ordered the ""wide fit"" because I need a bit more room at the sides, so these fit well and were comfortable throughout the day. No need to ""cut the strings"" as another viewer suggested. They were designed well to accommodate most people if you choose the fit you actually need. It's nice to be able to slip the shoes on and off with ease as I am at an age where bending over is not as easy as it used to be. But I suppose it doesn't matter how old you are, these Skechers slip-ons are great for any age if only for convenience. Highly recommend!"
Skechers,2024-04-02,"Extremely comfortable shoes.  Exact to listed size.  Easy to slip on. Look to be well made, time will tell.  As long as they turn out to be durable I would buy again."
Skechers,2024-02-29,"A huge plus of course is not needing to pull these on and just slipping into them.. Great at an Airport or just on the go, takes seconds. Comfort is very good, very light weight, I am a heavy walker not sure how these or going to feel after a few miles under them, time will tell.A Plus feature if you have narrow feet get the regulars and if you need to you can cut the laces and use them to get the desired comfort, tie them off and they fit like a glove now and still able to slip them on and off with zero effort, even when I did this. Loved them so much ordered two pairs, one around the house but I recommend Oofo's for that as well, they are the best if you have Plantar fasciitis.Pros:Very ComfortableDo what they say, slip on with easyNot bad lookingLight weightGreat for short walks so far, haven't tried longer than 2 miles.Perfect for travel, easy to removeCan be adjusted if you have narrow feet ""using laces"". Tying them and still be able to slip them on for a more comfortable fit.Cons:Seemed wider than what I am used to for a regular width.Durability ""Unsure"" about this oneLong term comfort ""Unsure""Thicker Shoe heal for more stability!"
Skechers,2024-03-13,"These shoes are great! Comfy, easy Mr Rogers slip on, and look good! But don’t try to sneak up on anybody as every step with my left shoe sounds like I’m stepping on crumpled cellophane. Don’t know if it’s just my pair or all of them that do this but cat burglars need to avoid these."
Skechers,2024-03-29,"I bought my first pair of these Slip Ins when I was going in for surgery and wouldn't be able to tie shoes for a few weeks. I loved that pair so much, I bought this pair and have been wearing them every day ever since...between both pairs, this is almost two years of wearing them constantly and I am a huge fan. Comfortable, slip on without any issues at all, stays on, are super light, affordable, and what else can you ask for? Thumbs up from me."
Skechers,2024-03-26,"Very nice,very light, super comfortable. True to size.These skechers are good quality I wanted to purchase again but unfortunately they run out.Happy with these shoes"
Skechers,2024-04-03,They're light extremely comfortable very easy to get on and off hands down gotta be the best shoe I've ever worn in 57 years they're so good I bought my 77-year-old father appear because it's easier for him to get on and off also these shoes are incredible I will be buying more of them when need be.
Skechers,2024-04-02,Love the slip in feature. I have nerve damage in one leg and it is painful to put on lace up shoes. These are effortless. Nice colors and style too.
Skechers,2024-04-06,"Very comfy out of the box. Nice style, can be worn with jeans, khakis or shorts. Fit is true to size."
Skechers,2024-03-24,"These shoes were much better than I expected.  Comfort, style and durability were second to none.  I am thoroughly enjoying these shoes."
Skechers,2023-11-10,Very comfortable. They are a bit wide but that’s okay for my feet. Look nice dressed up or casual.
Skechers,2024-04-04,"My daughter said “great shoes, trendy and age appropriate”.  These are my new favorites and I typically buy more expensive shoes.  These go with everything and look good with jeans as well as business casual.  I’ll buy them again."
Skechers,2024-04-09,"I got these shoes as a birthday present for my husband, and he just loves them. They look super cute on him, very flattering and go well with both casual and elegant outfits. He says they're also super comfortable and wants to get them in other colors too. Great purchase if you're looking for stylish vegan sneakers."
Skechers,2024-03-20,"Love these shoes, perfect fit & so comfortable, look good too"
Skechers,2023-10-20,"Ordered the 11.5 W. Build quality, comfy insole, and width were all good. Length felt off and was noticeable longer than my other shoes that are all 11.5 Wides. Too hesitant to try to order a smaller size.Recieved the box from Peltz shoes. It comes with detailed instructions on how to process the return. Felt like they were going to reject it so took lots of pictures before shipping with UPS through Amazon Return process. Delivered in Oct. 18th and return started Oct. 19th so let's see."
Skechers,2023-09-21,"We tried out several shoes this summer for my son and this was the winner. Great shoe for the money. He doesn't have a wide foot but he needs a wider toe box, this shoe worked great. Comfortable and stylish as well as affordable. easy to pack in his luggage and worked with many different types of outfits. This was a great find for him!"
PUMA,2024-04-14,"I use it for cricket. Nice shoes, they hold up well. Very comfortable and good looking, and the studs are really well made, resistant to abrasion, and provide a nice grip on baseball fields and astro-turf. Would highly recommend for any non-kicking sport (like soccer)."
PUMA,2023-12-12,"Have played two rounds so far (and I'm a walker - don't use carts). Good support, and very comfortable almost immediately - i.e., they didn't really need to be broken in. You can tell how well (or poorly) a golf shoe is made by how your feet feel after walking a long course. Any flaws in design, materials, or manufacturing immediately show up as an ""Advil ouch!"" somewhere (arch, toes, or etc.) on your feet post round. IMO, before you even start talking about how a shoe is to play golf in, it has to pass the first test ... quite simply, whether they are they are just plain good walking shoes. (Walking a standard 18 hole course averages around 6.5 miles.) These passed that test.So far as golfing, I have occasionally had problems with ""spikeless"" golf shoes slipping, especially on wet tee boxes, but these grabbed and held just fine. One of my rounds was the day after some heavy rains, with a lot of the course still quite damp, but I experienced no difficulties.Should also mention (re: moisture) that while the tongue and upper part of the shoe (that wraps around the ankle) are cloth, the main body of the shoe is a sort of plastic/rubber material that is completely waterproof. In other words, if you played in the rain, or walked through standing water puddles an inch or two deep your feet might wind up wet - but if you are just walking on moist, post-rain or watered fairways, these shoes are functionally waterproof.Minor issue to bring up? These shoes do use that kind of ""wrap-around"" construction where the foot slides inside a sort of glove (i.e., opening the tongue doesn't fully open the shoe itself). I happen to like that style, as the shoe fits slightly more firmly and the tongue doesn't wander as much during the round. But it does make the shoe a bit harder to put on. I use a shoehorn. Now personally this doesn't bother me at all, in fact one of the benefits of spikeless shoes is that I don't have to mess with changing them sitting on the trunk of my car at the course - I can put them on at home, and easily drive with them.(I only mention this because the primary value of Amazon reviews - many of which I've benefitted from - comes from hearing the experiential impressions of those that have used products, rather than just reading the marketing materials the company puts on the website. So while I have no problem with this - others might find it slightly irritating.)Can't yet comment on durability as I've only had them a couple weeks or so, but I'm a walker (and even worse, usually carry, i.e., not even a push cart), so it's not like any shoe last years or something.Final thing I'd mention - and this is just a personal preference - I really like the aesthetics. They simply look good. Very understated. I really don't like flashy, brightly colored, dramatic shoes (so many these days almost seem to want to make a ""look at me!"" statement). But the fundamental purpose of golf shoes is to ... well ... play golf. When I'm standing over a putt, I don't want my shoes yelling ""look at me"", I want them so quiet I almost forget they're there. These have a kind of calm elegance about them.Bottom line, I've played golf for a long time. Have some fairly expensive shoes (G/FORE, Johnston & Murphy). These are easily fairly close to that league. If I had paid $150, I'd still be leaving the positive review of a satisfied customer. At less than $100? I consider these to be a somewhat unusual find."
PUMA,2024-01-20,"Love this show, the look, very comfortable, it’s very grippy, but you do not want to drive with these shoes, they are very slick on bottom except on mat or grass/ground. They are for golf. I absolutely love them. I give them a five star. Not being able to drive with them on is just something I thought I would tell everyone so they wouldn’t get in a wreck. If you have a pair, you know how slippery they are on the bottom. Also they seem like they will last a long time. The grip on bottom is very thick and it has very great grip shape to it, definitely will keep you from slipping while hitting the ball as hard as you can. I tried on the ECCO golf shoes and they were very comfortable too, but they were $289.00. These are normally $160.00. And they are about the same comfort as the double the money ECCO shoe. Again with a great grip!!!!!"
PUMA,2024-03-26,"Fits great and performs well. I like shoes with spikes, but these perform just as well. Great price."
PUMA,2024-03-22,"Very comfortable once foot is in shoe. The non-moveable tongue takes a bit getting used to, but shoe fits well and no break-in period needed before you walk the golf course!!"
PUMA,2024-03-12,These are the best golf shoes that I've ever owned.
PUMA,2023-10-23,"I purchased these to replace an aging pair of Puma golf shoes that i have had great success with.  These look great and i actually had a couple of comments on them at the course.  They are a bit snug to put on as the top of the shoe is actually one piece with no separate tongue.  I am sure they will be great for wet conditions for that same reason.  And as another reviewer wrote, they would benefit from a heel loop to assist in getting into the shoe. First impressions are that they are very comfortable and perform well.  I have only played one round in them but so far so good.  Size 14"
PUMA,2024-02-27,"These are by far the most comfortable golf shoe for my feet. I have wide and very flat feet. These were amazing in the first round i played with them. Not even a sign of foot pain, discomfort,  blisters, etc.. I usually wear 11.5/12 depending on brand. These in 11.5 wide are perfect. I will be buying every color and extras so I can have them for the next decade and not need to search for a new kind. Puma, if you see this, hook me up with a few pairs 😁😁"
PUMA,2024-04-13,Comfortable and true to size.
PUMA,2024-04-07,I got these due to price and looks and I am glad I did. I have another new pair from a different brand I’ll use as my every day sneaker and these will be for working out. They are comfortable and they fit perfectly.
PUMA,2024-03-11,These shoes fit perfact but they are on the thin side with very little padding in the sides or heal but comfort fit insoles makes them very comfortable
PUMA,2024-03-05,"These sneakers are lightweight, very comfortable, stylish and of very good quality. German design made in Vietnam. Recommend!"
PUMA,2024-04-11,I like it. The fit was true to size. Well made and I thought the price was fair. I would recommend.
PUMA,2024-03-10,"This is a really comfortable Shoe. Provides a very comfortable walk. Because of the black color, it's good as a formal and casual wear. Pitch black color causes it to show dust readily but a quick sponging with a wet cloth makes it very clean and shiny."
PUMA,2024-03-01,"I'm a first time buyer of this particular brand of shoe, and so far I like them.  I didn't realize at the time I placeed the order that they are running shoes, I don't run unless something is chasing me, but that's ok, the extra cushioning is helpful.  I don't like that they're black though, maybe I missed the color option tab when ordering(?) but I'll live with the color. I also hate that I had to pay almost $80 for them, that's a little expensive for a pair of shoes, but the brand name is what sells them.  Review edit 3/17/24, After having these shoes for about two weks I discovered that the shoes are too narrow and have caused some minor issues, but I think I'll keep them because it's not worth the effort to request a return and not get a response until the day the return window closes, so I will be looking at other sources for a new pair of shoes."
PUMA,2024-03-27,"Nice shoe for price. Needed for standing long hours, does a good job of holding up"
PUMA,2024-03-04,Perfect fit. Great look. Lightweight. Great shoes for $44
PUMA,2024-02-29,These Puma are really comfortable running shoes and they look really good too.
PUMA,2023-08-28,"I ordered the wide pair of shoes thinking they may be too wide. Glad I did. These are very snug and hopefully in time they'll break in nicely. As far as looks go, they're better than I thought they'd look. I'm really impressed on the quality and how they look on my feet!"
PUMA,2024-02-21,"Great looking shoe and comfortable, and puma are not hipacrits"
PUMA,2024-03-28,Too tight across toe
PUMA,2024-02-04,"Comfortable,  good looking and reasonable price"
PUMA,2023-11-25,I buy a pair of puma sneakers every year for my father who is a hard worker and never has any nice things due to working . He loves the comfort and stability the sneakers offer and the breathability due to his arthritis and swelling of his feet and ankles from an injury when he broke the heel of his foot ! It's been almost 10 yrs since I have been buying these sneakers for him and he loves them so much
PUMA,2023-12-09,I run a bar and these hold up extremely well to constant everyday wear! Couldn’t recommend more!!
PUMA,2024-04-08,My son loves these shoes he needed something with more comfort for his feet and not too tight or heavy like alot of other sneakers.
PUMA,2024-02-09,I really feel satisfied with this purchased. They are beautiful and fit with my feet.
PUMA,2023-11-01,These sneakers are very light with breathable material. The soles are very thin so they are no good for walking on a gravel or stone trail. Also the insoles kinda wore out where my big toe is. The laces on the side of the shoe are the actual laces. They go all the way on the outside of the shoe and back. Kind of weird and took some getting used to. The sizing was spot on.
PUMA,2024-01-22,"Good price, comfortable and easy to clean."
PUMA,2024-03-09,I like the look and the are very comfortable as a walking shoe at work. Hopefully they will last a long time.
PUMA,2024-03-07,I totally love these shoes:  purchased these to replace an older pair of Black Puma Cells and these are even better!  Memory foam base is very comfortable and the fit (as in typical Puma fashion) is perfect as long as you go up 1/2 size in American sizing.
PUMA,2023-12-21,Was a bit snug compared to other shows of same size.  Otherwise nice shoe
PUMA,2024-04-15,Can’t go wrong with black pumas!
PUMA,2024-03-21,I like these shoes a lot. They look good and fit perfectly. Very comfortable. My first go with spikeless and I'm very impressed with the grip these give on the grass.
PUMA,2024-04-07,Needed a pair of golf shoes while in Florida for the winter.  Found these shoes and received quick delivery.  Played a round without breaking in with no problems.  Shoes are comfortable and good looking.  Lightweight and good foundation grip during my swing.  Recommend as a value golf shoe.
PUMA,2024-04-03,If you have wide feet you know it can be difficult to find comfortable golf shoes. These work and a great price point.
PUMA,2024-03-15,For the price great fit and comfortable to walk 18
PUMA,2024-03-10,Good fit and good looking shoe.
PUMA,2024-01-11,"Bought for son, he loves them and says very comfortable and lightweight"
PUMA,2024-01-15,Love these shoes.. they are very comfortable to walk in and come in wide!  Great colors and value.
PUMA,2023-12-20,Nice golf shoe for a beginner
PUMA,2024-01-06,"All of these Pumas are super nice, and priced half of Nike, Merrill, and Columbia.  I own over 30 pairs of various brands and consider these and other Pumas the best for price, and comfort.  Not really a sports shoe, but great walking shoe, on the heavy side for sports or running."
PUMA,2024-04-13,Great pair of shoes. Classy and comfortable.
PUMA,2024-03-18,Didn't like the size.
PUMA,2024-04-15,Very good quality and comfort
PUMA,2024-02-26,"Great Looking Sneakers, fit is good, good quality construction, would recommend to all my friends"
PUMA,2024-04-03,I always like my pumas. They are a little bit narrower Than I like and they was not a wide sizing option. But nonetheless cool looking and super fast shipping.
PUMA,2024-01-25,"These are quite attractive and go great with my black jeans.  They are very comfortable and I feel confident when I wear them and I know I look good (isn't that what we all want?)  They are on my feet three or four times a month.  They are part of a collection of athletic shoes that include Puma, Nike, Skechers and Reebok.  Because I own quite a number of athletic shoes, I feel that I am a pretty good judge.  I generally do not purchase brushed leather due to cleaning issues, but these are easily wiped down without losing color or looking like they have been cleaned like some brushed leather shoes do.  A definite yes for those who like to compliment black jeans and black t-shirt.  They make me look bad-ass."
PUMA,2024-03-21,Fits perfectly
PUMA,2024-03-18,"Just a hair on the small / short side, but nothing too bad at all.  All sizes are a bit different.  However, the shoes are very conforming and comfortable.  I would recommend."
PUMA,2024-03-21,super comfortable and light weight. a nice change from by work boots when weather is nice and i'm working inside and don't need the extra protection or on my days off...just a nice walking around shoe...and it looks great doing it too
PUMA,2023-11-11,"These are a tad heavy and clunky to me, so I probably wouldn't ever wear them to run. I just really liked the way that looked, so I bought two different colors of this style, and will definitely keep both pairs. I actually bought seven total pairs of new running shoes at the same time (Nike, Adidas, and Puma) and weighed them all, and these are the heaviest out of all of them, but it doesn't bother me because I bought them as casual shoes to wear with jeans, etc. I have very narrow feet with extremely high arches, and I typically like my shoes to fit pretty tightly. These are very snug, which I like, but a lot of people might not. The soles are very cushioned and almost feel a little too soft, which most people will probably love, but they make me feel a little goofy, like I'm walking on shoes with rounded soles. The lacing is a little weird because the lace loops are near the soles, rather than the top of the shoes, like 99.9% of other shoes have, so they're kind of awkward to lace up to the right preference, too. However, for this price, I'm extremely happy with them, overall."
PUMA,2024-02-27,"I would give these shoes a 4.5 stars only because they look so white in the pictures, but in person they are more of an off white. They came in a timely manner, they are comfortable, if you're a woman with big feet (like I am) you wouldn't be able to tell they are men's shoes. 😉  love them, would consider ordering more. Just wish men shoes had some pink (or other gender neutral type of color) accented options, but I understand why they don't."
PUMA,2024-03-29,Great shoes!! My son loves the look and feel of them. He said he feels taller in them! He can be picky at times so I take this as a win!I want a pair too!!
PUMA,2024-02-01,"The headline say it all, I absolutely love my new Puma's. I love the way they look, they are comfortable & the fit is perfect giving great support for when I'm working out, which BTW is why I bought them.This is a three thumbs up recommended buy!"
PUMA,2024-04-16,"I don’t know what it is but these shoes have got to be one of the, if not the # 1, most comfortable shoes I own.  I bought them for the looks but ended up loving them for their comfort.  Big fan.  10/10. Would buy again."
PUMA,2024-03-13,"Good price, looks good but not comfortable at all on the feet."
PUMA,2024-04-03,Comfortable- true to size- nice color
PUMA,2024-04-08,"This is my 3rd pair (3 different colors) of these golf shoes. They are the most comfortable golf shoes I've ever owned. They are like lightweight, breathable tennis shoes - perfect for SoCal summers."
PUMA,2023-11-06,"Comfortable, light weight not a lot of support and I found it ran 1/2 size small."
PUMA,2023-09-22,True to size- and so cute!! Not clunky like my other golf shoes
PUMA,2023-06-26,Very comfortable and pretty. The only thing that I would change is the opening for your foot to go into is a little bit small so when I slide my foot in I have to push it and it wrinkles my sock up because the opening is slightly tight. Once I get it on though it's perfect. (If my sock isn't still wrinkled up).
PUMA,2023-07-16,Too clunky
PUMA,2023-06-08,"These shoes are true to size and very comfortable on the course. Traction is moderate, so I wouldn’t wear on wet grass. I plan on buying another color. Will update review later in the season to see how they hold up to regular wear."
PUMA,2023-07-31,Very comfy and cute golf shoes. They were a great price for a pair of golf shoes. They are a little flat footed but this is the style of most golf shoes.
PUMA,2023-08-25,"I purchased these golf shoes because I wanted something that was a lighter weight option compared to my older golf shoes that are leather.  These were exactly what I was looking for.Fit/Size:  They seem to fit a little tight around the middle of my foot, but only slightly.  I think it's kind of the nature of this type of shoe that you have to slip on.  That said, it is still comfortable because of the mesh design, so it isn't uncomfortably tight.Comfort:  These are the most comfortable golf shoes I've owned.  I like the insole, which provides good support and comfort throughout golf rounds.  One feature I noticed is that it seems to have a little more support on the outer portion of the insole.  I assume this is a design feature, as it helps to keep weight on the inside of the feet during the swing.  I also really like the mesh design, as they keep my feet cool during the summer golf season.Durability:  The build quality seems really good.  The sole is holding up great and the grip is not wearing down very quickly, which is important since this is a spikeless shoe.Design/Looks:  I really love how these shoes look.  They are conservative, but with a pop of color.  The light color does get dirty, but the mesh design makes it pretty easy to pop them in the washing machine to get them clean.Overall, I would highly recommend.  They are well made, comfortable, and look great!"
PUMA,2022-04-19,"Good fit, good value, and excellent quality. Golf shoes are always a trade off between comfort and stability, and these shoes pull it off very well. They're so comfortable I have forgotten to change back into my regular shoes after the round before driving home. One star taken off due to them being the most difficult shoes to put on I have ever encountered. There is no tongue, so the opening you have to push your foot through is very small. In addition, there is a weird mechanism that keeps the laces tight making widening the opening even harder. Overall, though, a great golf shoe.Edit: I am changing my rating up to a 5 star having found that, using a shoehorn, these shoes are actually very easy to put on. Without doubt the most comfortable golf shoes I have ever worn."
PUMA,2022-04-12,"I couldn't decide whether to give these shoes 3 or 4 stars but gave them the higher number.  When I first looked at these shoes up close, I discovered that they don't have a tongue.  I've never seen athletic shoes like that.  It's all built in one piece, which could create a problem if the shoelace breaks.  When I first tried to put them on, I found it impossible, so thought they were too small and had to be returned.  However, I had a big shoehorn and got them on with some effort.  Once on they fit perfectly and felt like slippers, only with excellent tread.  I've enjoyed walking around in them, but doubt if they'd hold up walking 18 holes.  I will try them the next time I cut my grass and see what happens.  The styling is unique if you want to try something different.  That's about all I can say until I've worn them longer."
PUMA,2024-01-15,Fit perfectly the very 1st time I put them on. Stylish look. I wear them for casual outing.
PUMA,2022-07-14,"perfect white golf shoes to walk during the hot summer. I bought the white ones and yes they do get dirty like all white shoes, especially considering where these go. Grass, dirt, sand, etc. do NOT buy white shoes if you are going to complain when they get dirty. Like all white shoes, they are high maintenance. I clean them when I get home and wash them every 3-4 uses. so far they are staying very white, but that's what it takes.The shoes are great they are comfortable, light weight, and good-looking. if you are looking for a summer shoe to walk in, these are it. I have spiked waterproof shoes that are great but boy do they get hot when walking 18 during the summer.I highly recommend these and I'm actually considering buy another pair maybe the black ones for when Im feeling lazy and don't want to spot clean after a round."
PUMA,2023-11-29,"I like the looks of shoes and more important, they are really comfortable. They seem to be sturdy but so far they have been great. The only thing I regret is that I wash I had picked a slightly darker shoe."
PUMA,2023-04-18,"I absolutely LOVE these pumas. I had them in black prior to purchasing these and I’m so glad I have white now.  While I was shopping, it was in between these and the Cole Haan Zero Grand Overtakes (which are 3x the price)! I figured I would try these out before I even thought about spending the $150 on the Cole Haans.  Sure enough, when they arrived and I slipped them on, THEY WERE PERFECT for me!  These pumas have less logo work on them compare to the CH shoes I wanted too which I loved. They’re so comfortable and they look easy to clean.  I have already worn them twice to practice in (both indoor hitting bay facilities) and I got questions on where I got them.  These are men’s size but so are my black ones. I wear a 9/9.5 and depending on the brand sometimes 10 in women’s shoes so went with the 8 in men’s. I could ask for a better fit! I highly recommend purchasing these shoes. Plus, they’re only $50! 😇🙏🏽⛳️🏌🏽‍♀️"
PUMA,2024-01-02,"My husband picked these out. Very happy with the price, quality,  and fit."
PUMA,2024-04-14,"I use it for cricket. Nice shoes, they hold up well. Very comfortable and good looking, and the studs are really well made, resistant to abrasion, and provide a nice grip on baseball fields and astro-turf. Would highly recommend for any non-kicking sport (like soccer)."

One of my rounds was the day after some heavy rains, with a lot of the course still quite damp, but I experienced no difficulties.Should also mention (re: moisture) that while the tongue and upper part of the shoe (that wraps around the ankle) are cloth, the main body of the shoe is a sort of plastic/rubber material that is completely waterproof. In other words, if you played in the rain, or walked through standing water puddles an inch or two deep your feet might wind up wet - but if you are just walking on moist, post-rain or watered fairways, these shoes are functionally waterproof.Minor issue to bring up? These shoes do use that kind of ""wrap-around"" construction where the foot slides inside a sort of glove (i.e., opening the tongue doesn't fully open the shoe itself). I happen to like that style, as the shoe fits slightly more firmly and the tongue doesn't wander as much during the round. But it does make the shoe a bit harder to put on. I use a shoehorn. Now personally this doesn't bother me at all, in fact one of the benefits of spikeless shoes is that I don't have to mess with changing them sitting on the trunk of my car at the course - I can put them on at home, and easily drive with them.(I only mention this because the primary value of Amazon reviews - many of which I've benefitted from - comes from hearing the experiential impressions of those that have used products, rather than just reading the marketing materials the company puts on the website. So while I have no problem with this - others might find it slightly irritating.)Can't yet comment on durability as I've only had them a couple weeks or so, but I'm a walker (and even worse, usually carry, i.e., not even a push cart), so it's not like any shoe last years or something.Final thing I'd mention - and this is just a personal preference - I really like the aesthetics. They simply look good. Very understated. I really don't like flashy, brightly colored, dramatic shoes (so many these days almost seem to want to make a ""look at me!"" statement). But the fundamental purpose of golf shoes is to ... well ... play golf. When I'm standing over a putt, I don't want my shoes yelling ""look at me"", I want them so quiet I almost forget they're there. These have a kind of calm elegance about them.Bottom line, I've played golf for a long time. Have some fairly expensive shoes (G/FORE, Johnston & Murphy). These are easily fairly close to that league. If I had paid $150, I'd still be leaving the positive review of a satisfied customer. At less than $100? I consider these to be a somewhat unusual find."
PUMA,2024-01-20,"Love this show, the look, very comfortable, it’s very grippy, but you do not want to drive with these shoes, they are very slick on bottom except on mat or grass/ground. They are for golf. I absolutely love them. I give them a five star. Not being able to drive with them on is just something I thought I would tell everyone so they wouldn’t get in a wreck. If you have a pair, you know how slippery they are on the bottom. Also they seem like they will last a long time. The grip on bottom is very thick and it has very great grip shape to it, definitely will keep you from slipping while hitting the ball as hard as you can. I tried on the ECCO golf shoes and they were very comfortable too, but they were $289.00. These are normally $160.00. And they are about the same comfort as the double the money ECCO shoe. Again with a great grip!!!!!"
PUMA,2024-03-26,"Fits great and performs well. I like shoes with spikes, but these perform just as well. Great price."
PUMA,2024-03-22,"Very comfortable once foot is in shoe. The non-moveable tongue takes a bit getting used to, but shoe fits well and no break-in period needed before you walk the golf course!!"
PUMA,2024-03-12,These are the best golf shoes that I've ever owned.
PUMA,2023-10-23,"I purchased these to replace an aging pair of Puma golf shoes that i have had great success with.  These look great and i actually had a couple of comments on them at the course.  They are a bit snug to put on as the top of the shoe is actually one piece with no separate tongue.  I am sure they will be great for wet conditions for that same reason.  And as another reviewer wrote, they would benefit from a heel loop to assist in getting into the shoe. First impressions are that they are very comfortable and perform well.  I have only played one round in them but so far so good.  Size 14"
PUMA,2024-02-27,"These are by far the most comfortable golf shoe for my feet. I have wide and very flat feet. These were amazing in the first round i played with them. Not even a sign of foot pain, discomfort,  blisters, etc.. I usually wear 11.5/12 depending on brand. These in 11.5 wide are perfect. I will be buying every color and extras so I can have them for the next decade and not need to search for a new kind. Puma, if you see this, hook me up with a few pairs 😁😁"
PUMA,2024-04-13,Comfortable and true to size.
PUMA,2024-04-07,I got these due to price and looks and I am glad I did. I have another new pair from a different brand I’ll use as my every day sneaker and these will be for working out. They are comfortable and they fit perfectly.
PUMA,2024-03-11,These shoes fit perfact but they are on the thin side with very little padding in the sides or heal but comfort fit insoles makes them very comfortable
PUMA,2024-03-05,"These sneakers are lightweight, very comfortable, stylish and of very good quality. German design made in Vietnam. Recommend!"
PUMA,2024-04-11,I like it. The fit was true to size. Well made and I thought the price was fair. I would recommend.
PUMA,2024-03-10,"This is a really comfortable Shoe. Provides a very comfortable walk. Because of the black color, it's good as a formal and casual wear. Pitch black color causes it to show dust readily but a quick sponging with a wet cloth makes it very clean and shiny."
PUMA,2024-03-01,"I'm a first time buyer of this particular brand of shoe, and so far I like them.  I didn't realize at the time I placeed the order that they are running shoes, I don't run unless something is chasing me, but that's ok, the extra cushioning is helpful.  I don't like that they're black though, maybe I missed the color option tab when ordering(?) but I'll live with the color. I also hate that I had to pay almost $80 for them, that's a little expensive for a pair of shoes, but the brand name is what sells them.  Review edit 3/17/24, After having these shoes for about two weks I discovered that the shoes are too narrow and have caused some minor issues, but I think I'll keep them because it's not worth the effort to request a return and not get a response until the day the return window closes, so I will be looking at other sources for a new pair of shoes."
PUMA,2024-03-27,"Nice shoe for price. Needed for standing long hours, does a good job of holding up"
PUMA,2024-03-04,Perfect fit. Great look. Lightweight. Great shoes for $44
PUMA,2024-02-29,These Puma are really comfortable running shoes and they look really good too.
PUMA,2023-08-28,"I ordered the wide pair of shoes thinking they may be too wide. Glad I did. These are very snug and hopefully in time they'll break in nicely. As far as looks go, they're better than I thought they'd look. I'm really impressed on the quality and how they look on my feet!"
PUMA,2024-02-21,"Great looking shoe and comfortable, and puma are not hipacrits"
PUMA,2024-03-28,Too tight across toe
PUMA,2024-02-04,"Comfortable,  good looking and reasonable price"
PUMA,2023-11-25,I buy a pair of puma sneakers every year for my father who is a hard worker and never has any nice things due to working . He loves the comfort and stability the sneakers offer and the breathability due to his arthritis and swelling of his feet and ankles from an injury when he broke the heel of his foot ! It's been almost 10 yrs since I have been buying these sneakers for him and he loves them so much
PUMA,2023-12-09,I run a bar and these hold up extremely well to constant everyday wear! Couldn’t recommend more!!
PUMA,2024-04-08,My son loves these shoes he needed something with more comfort for his feet and not too tight or heavy like alot of other sneakers.
PUMA,2024-02-09,I really feel satisfied with this purchased. They are beautiful and fit with my feet.
PUMA,2023-11-01,These sneakers are very light with breathable material. The soles are very thin so they are no good for walking on a gravel or stone trail. Also the insoles kinda wore out where my big toe is. The laces on the side of the shoe are the actual laces. They go all the way on the outside of the shoe and back. Kind of weird and took some getting used to. The sizing was spot on.
PUMA,2024-01-22,"Good price, comfortable and easy to clean."
PUMA,2024-03-09,I like the look and the are very comfortable as a walking shoe at work. Hopefully they will last a long time.
PUMA,2024-03-07,I totally love these shoes:  purchased these to replace an older pair of Black Puma Cells and these are even better!  Memory foam base is very comfortable and the fit (as in typical Puma fashion) is perfect as long as you go up 1/2 size in American sizing.
PUMA,2023-12-21,Was a bit snug compared to other shows of same size.  Otherwise nice shoe
PUMA,2024-04-15,Can’t go wrong with black pumas!
PUMA,2024-03-21,I like these shoes a lot. They look good and fit perfectly. Very comfortable. My first go with spikeless and I'm very impressed with the grip these give on the grass.
PUMA,2024-04-07,Needed a pair of golf shoes while in Florida for the winter.  Found these shoes and received quick delivery.  Played a round without breaking in with no problems.  Shoes are comfortable and good looking.  Lightweight and good foundation grip during my swing.  Recommend as a value golf shoe.
PUMA,2024-04-03,If you have wide feet you know it can be difficult to find comfortable golf shoes. These work and a great price point.
PUMA,2024-03-15,For the price great fit and comfortable to walk 18
PUMA,2024-03-10,Good fit and good looking shoe.
PUMA,2024-01-11,"Bought for son, he loves them and says very comfortable and lightweight"
PUMA,2024-01-15,Love these shoes.. they are very comfortable to walk in and come in wide!  Great colors and value.
PUMA,2023-12-20,Nice golf shoe for a beginner
PUMA,2024-01-06,"All of these Pumas are super nice, and priced half of Nike, Merrill, and Columbia.  I own over 30 pairs of various brands and consider these and other Pumas the best for price, and comfort.  Not really a sports shoe, but great walking shoe, on the heavy side for sports or running."
PUMA,2024-04-13,Great pair of shoes. Classy and comfortable.
PUMA,2024-03-18,Didn't like the size.
PUMA,2024-04-15,Very good quality and comfort
PUMA,2024-02-26,"Great Looking Sneakers, fit is good, good quality construction, would recommend to all my friends"
PUMA,2024-04-03,I always like my pumas. They are a little bit narrower Than I like and they was not a wide sizing option. But nonetheless cool looking and super fast shipping.
PUMA,2024-01-25,"These are quite attractive and go great with my black jeans.  They are very comfortable and I feel confident when I wear them and I know I look good (isn't that what we all want?)  They are on my feet three or four times a month.  They are part of a collection of athletic shoes that include Puma, Nike, Skechers and Reebok.  Because I own quite a number of athletic shoes, I feel that I am a pretty good judge.  I generally do not purchase brushed leather due to cleaning issues, but these are easily wiped down without losing color or looking like they have been cleaned like some brushed leather shoes do.  A definite yes for those who like to compliment black jeans and black t-shirt.  They make me look bad-ass."
PUMA,2024-03-21,Fits perfectly
PUMA,2024-03-18,"Just a hair on the small / short side, but nothing too bad at all.  All sizes are a bit different.  However, the shoes are very conforming and comfortable.  I would recommend."
PUMA,2024-03-21,super comfortable and light weight. a nice change from by work boots when weather is nice and i'm working inside and don't need the extra protection or on my days off...just a nice walking around shoe...and it looks great doing it too
PUMA,2023-11-11,"These are a tad heavy and clunky to me, so I probably wouldn't ever wear them to run. I just really liked the way that looked, so I bought two different colors of this style, and will definitely keep both pairs. I actually bought seven total pairs of new running shoes at the same time (Nike, Adidas, and Puma) and weighed them all, and these are the heaviest out of all of them, but it doesn't bother me because I bought them as casual shoes to wear with jeans, etc. I have very narrow feet with extremely high arches, and I typically like my shoes to fit pretty tightly. These are very snug, which I like, but a lot of people might not. The soles are very cushioned and almost feel a little too soft, which most people will probably love, but they make me feel a little goofy, like I'm walking on shoes with rounded soles. The lacing is a little weird because the lace loops are near the soles, rather than the top of the shoes, like 99.9% of other shoes have, so they're kind of awkward to lace up to the right preference, too. However, for this price, I'm extremely happy with them, overall."
PUMA,2024-02-27,"I would give these shoes a 4.5 stars only because they look so white in the pictures, but in person they are more of an off white. They came in a timely manner, they are comfortable, if you're a woman with big feet (like I am) you wouldn't be able to tell they are men's shoes. 😉  love them, would consider ordering more. Just wish men shoes had some pink (or other gender neutral type of color) accented options, but I understand why they don't."
PUMA,2024-03-29,Great shoes!! My son loves the look and feel of them. He said he feels taller in them! He can be picky at times so I take this as a win!I want a pair too!!
PUMA,2024-02-01,"The headline say it all, I absolutely love my new Puma's. I love the way they look, they are comfortable & the fit is perfect giving great support for when I'm working out, which BTW is why I bought them.This is a three thumbs up recommended buy!"
PUMA,2024-04-16,"I don’t know what it is but these shoes have got to be one of the, if not the # 1, most comfortable shoes I own.  I bought them for the looks but ended up loving them for their comfort.  Big fan.  10/10. Would buy again."
PUMA,2024-03-13,"Good price, looks good but not comfortable at all on the feet."
PUMA,2024-04-03,Comfortable- true to size- nice color
PUMA,2024-04-08,"This is my 3rd pair (3 different colors) of these golf shoes. They are the most comfortable golf shoes I've ever owned. They are like lightweight, breathable tennis shoes - perfect for SoCal summers."
PUMA,2023-11-06,"Comfortable, light weight not a lot of support and I found it ran 1/2 size small."
PUMA,2023-09-22,True to size- and so cute!! Not clunky like my other golf shoes
PUMA,2023-06-26,Very comfortable and pretty. The only thing that I would change is the opening for your foot to go into is a little bit small so when I slide my foot in I have to push it and it wrinkles my sock up because the opening is slightly tight. Once I get it on though it's perfect. (If my sock isn't still wrinkled up).
PUMA,2023-07-16,Too clunky
PUMA,2023-06-08,"These shoes are true to size and very comfortable on the course. Traction is moderate, so I wouldn’t wear on wet grass. I plan on buying another color. Will update review later in the season to see how they hold up to regular wear."
PUMA,2023-07-31,Very comfy and cute golf shoes. They were a great price for a pair of golf shoes. They are a little flat footed but this is the style of most golf shoes.
PUMA,2023-08-25,"I purchased these golf shoes because I wanted something that was a lighter weight option compared to my older golf shoes that are leather.  These were exactly what I was looking for.Fit/Size:  They seem to fit a little tight around the middle of my foot, but only slightly.  I think it's kind of the nature of this type of shoe that you have to slip on.  That said, it is still comfortable because of the mesh design, so it isn't uncomfortably tight.Comfort:  These are the most comfortable golf shoes I've owned.  I like the insole, which provides good support and comfort throughout golf rounds.  One feature I noticed is that it seems to have a little more support on the outer portion of the insole.  I assume this is a design feature, as it helps to keep weight on the inside of the feet during the swing.  I also really like the mesh design, as they keep my feet cool during the summer golf season.Durability:  The build quality seems really good.  The sole is holding up great and the grip is not wearing down very quickly, which is important since this is a spikeless shoe.Design/Looks:  I really love how these shoes look.  They are conservative, but with a pop of color.  The light color does get dirty, but the mesh design makes it pretty easy to pop them in the washing machine to get them clean.Overall, I would highly recommend.  They are well made, comfortable, and look great!"
PUMA,2022-04-19,"Good fit, good value, and excellent quality. Golf shoes are always a trade off between comfort and stability, and these shoes pull it off very well. They're so comfortable I have forgotten to change back into my regular shoes after the round before driving home. One star taken off due to them being the most difficult shoes to put on I have ever encountered. There is no tongue, so the opening you have to push your foot through is very small. In addition, there is a weird mechanism that keeps the laces tight making widening the opening even harder. Overall, though, a great golf shoe.Edit: I am changing my rating up to a 5 star having found that, using a shoehorn, these shoes are actually very easy to put on. Without doubt the most comfortable golf shoes I have ever worn."
PUMA,2022-04-12,"I couldn't decide whether to give these shoes 3 or 4 stars but gave them the higher number.  When I first looked at these shoes up close, I discovered that they don't have a tongue.  I've never seen athletic shoes like that.  It's all built in one piece, which could create a problem if the shoelace breaks.  When I first tried to put them on, I found it impossible, so thought they were too small and had to be returned.  However, I had a big shoehorn and got them on with some effort.  Once on they fit perfectly and felt like slippers, only with excellent tread.  I've enjoyed walking around in them, but doubt if they'd hold up walking 18 holes.  I will try them the next time I cut my grass and see what happens.  The styling is unique if you want to try something different.  That's about all I can say until I've worn them longer."
PUMA,2024-01-15,Fit perfectly the very 1st time I put them on. Stylish look. I wear them for casual outing.
PUMA,2022-07-14,"perfect white golf shoes to walk during the hot summer. I bought the white ones and yes they do get dirty like all white shoes, especially considering where these go. Grass, dirt, sand, etc. do NOT buy white shoes if you are going to complain when they get dirty. Like all white shoes, they are high maintenance. I clean them when I get home and wash them every 3-4 uses. so far they are staying very white, but that's what it takes.The shoes are great they are comfortable, light weight, and good-looking. if you are looking for a summer shoe to walk in, these are it. I have spiked waterproof shoes that are great but boy do they get hot when walking 18 during the summer.I highly recommend these and I'm actually considering buy another pair maybe the black ones for when Im feeling lazy and don't want to spot clean after a round."
PUMA,2023-11-29,"I like the looks of shoes and more important, they are really comfortable. They seem to be sturdy but so far they have been great. The only thing I regret is that I wash I had picked a slightly darker shoe."
PUMA,2023-04-18,"I absolutely LOVE these pumas. I had them in black prior to purchasing these and I’m so glad I have white now.  While I was shopping, it was in between these and the Cole Haan Zero Grand Overtakes (which are 3x the price)! I figured I would try these out before I even thought about spending the $150 on the Cole Haans.  Sure enough, when they arrived and I slipped them on, THEY WERE PERFECT for me!  These pumas have less logo work on them compare to the CH shoes I wanted too which I loved. They’re so comfortable and they look easy to clean.  I have already worn them twice to practice in (both indoor hitting bay facilities) and I got questions on where I got them.  These are men’s size but so are my black ones. I wear a 9/9.5 and depending on the brand sometimes 10 in women’s shoes so went with the 8 in men’s. I could ask for a better fit! I highly recommend purchasing these shoes. Plus, they’re only $50! 😇🙏🏽⛳️🏌🏽‍♀️"
PUMA,2024-01-02,"My husband picked these out. Very happy with the price, quality,  and fit."
PUMA,2024-04-14,"I use it for cricket. Nice shoes, they hold up well. Very comfortable and good looking, and the studs are really well made, resistant to abrasion, and provide a nice grip on baseball fields and astro-turf. Would highly recommend for any non-kicking sport (like soccer)."
PUMA,2023-12-12,"Have played two rounds so far (and I'm a walker - don't use carts). Good support, and very comfortable almost immediately - i.e., they didn't really need to be broken in. You can tell how well (or poorly) a golf shoe is made by how your feet feel after walking a long course. Any flaws in design, materials, or manufacturing immediately show up as an ""Advil ouch!"" somewhere (arch, toes, or etc.) on your feet post round. IMO, before you even start talking about how a shoe is to play golf in, it has to pass the first test ... quite simply, whether they are they are just plain good walking shoes. (Walking a standard 18 hole course averages around 6.5 miles.) These passed that test.So far as golfing, I have occasionally had problems with ""spikeless"" golf shoes slipping, especially on wet tee boxes, but these grabbed and held just fine.

PUMA,2023-08-28,"I ordered the wide pair of shoes thinking they may be too wide. Glad I did. These are very snug and hopefully in time they'll break in nicely. As far as looks go, they're better than I thought they'd look. I'm really impressed on the quality and how they look on my feet!"
PUMA,2024-02-21,"Great looking shoe and comfortable, and puma are not hipacrits"
PUMA,2024-03-28,Too tight across toe
PUMA,2024-02-04,"Comfortable,  good looking and reasonable price"
PUMA,2023-11-25,I buy a pair of puma sneakers every year for my father who is a hard worker and never has any nice things due to working . He loves the comfort and stability the sneakers offer and the breathability due to his arthritis and swelling of his feet and ankles from an injury when he broke the heel of his foot ! It's been almost 10 yrs since I have been buying these sneakers for him and he loves them so much
PUMA,2023-12-09,I run a bar and these hold up extremely well to constant everyday wear! Couldn’t recommend more!!
PUMA,2024-04-08,My son loves these shoes he needed something with more comfort for his feet and not too tight or heavy like alot of other sneakers.
PUMA,2024-02-09,I really feel satisfied with this purchased. They are beautiful and fit with my feet.
PUMA,2023-11-01,These sneakers are very light with breathable material. The soles are very thin so they are no good for walking on a gravel or stone trail. Also the insoles kinda wore out where my big toe is. The laces on the side of the shoe are the actual laces. They go all the way on the outside of the shoe and back. Kind of weird and took some getting used to. The sizing was spot on.
PUMA,2024-01-22,"Good price, comfortable and easy to clean."
PUMA,2024-03-09,I like the look and the are very comfortable as a walking shoe at work. Hopefully they will last a long time.
PUMA,2024-03-07,I totally love these shoes:  purchased these to replace an older pair of Black Puma Cells and these are even better!  Memory foam base is very comfortable and the fit (as in typical Puma fashion) is perfect as long as you go up 1/2 size in American sizing.
PUMA,2023-12-21,Was a bit snug compared to other shows of same size.  Otherwise nice shoe
PUMA,2024-04-15,Can’t go wrong with black pumas!
Nike,2024-04-12,"Wow what can I say, I ordered these Nike Air Force 1 for my brother and these are amazing great, Amazing quality and they fit perfect great color everything look just like the photo and  came just in time"
Nike,2024-03-04,Look and fits fine. Timely shipping. I would do business with again.
Nike,2024-02-20,"I bought these shoes for work because it’s dress code (for black shoes) and a few Co worker’s recommended Them. I work in a very “Shoe abusive"" environment, so I thought it would be a waste of money, BUT NO! They have lasted longer than any other Shoe that I’ve worn, and are fairly comfortable. So yes I highly recommend these shoes."

Nike,2024-03-29,Good for my daily run . Not tight for me
Nike,2024-03-10,I generally like the Pegasus Air Zoom line. A fresh pair of shoes also helps prevent plantar fascists. The one thing I don't like about the new design is the pointed heel on the sole. It actually creates holes in my car carpet matts quicker than a rounded heel.
Nike,2024-04-05,Talla perfecta y muy comodos
Nike,2024-01-11,I have ordered the same pair of shoes 3 different times over the past 3 weeks. I have ordered a US size 11. Each time I am sent a US size 10.

Nike,2024-01-11,"I bought several pairs of basketball shoes for a gift, the choice was simple as soon as they slipped this pair on. It was instant comfort with decent style. They aren’t as flashy as other big name shoes but they are a solid go to for everyday comfort. Size was a perfect fit."
Nike,2024-03-28,I had to return the sneakers because one of the soles was bumpy. The return process was easy and I received my refund in a timely manner. I ordered another pair and they came fast. My son loves them.

Nike,2024-03-27,Awesome shoes and decent price
Nike,2024-04-05,These shoes are dialed in hardcore. One of the best looking Nikes out there. The laser cut sole design is sick! Not as comfortable as some of the other Nike running shoes that I've had but damn they look nice!
Nike,2024-01-13,"Bought for my son in law for Christmas, and he loved the.  Said they are very comfortable and seem to be holding up good.  He goes through a pair of shoes every couple months with his job and he's had these for a month, and they still look to be in good condition."

Nike,2024-01-30,Very comfortable and light weight. Great working shoe for those that are on there feet all day long.
Nike,2024-03-21,Good shoe. Not too soft or too hard. Fit is okay for me. Breaking them in still. The boat tail at the back of the shoe reminds me of the Art Nouveau styles of my youth.
Nike,2023-08-21,"I wanted to love these because I've had some model of Pegasus before (can't remember which) that was JUST wide enough for me to wear and they had the BEST of the best soles I've ever stepped down on. Unfortunately, this particular model was super narrow (like most Nike shoes) and I couldn't even wear them a full day. If your feet are narrow or even typical width, I urge you to try these because they are amazing on your feet."

Nike,2024-04-15,It’s very comfortable and stylish. I love it
Nike,2023-10-07,I have been wearing zoom Pegasus for 25 years. I ran in them from middle school through college. I have never needed to replace a pair of shoes before 6 months even at 100 miles a week.I currently run 10-15 miles a week. I wear my Pegasus only to run in. I noticed the foam starting to degrade 2 months ago and the tread was getting low a month ago. This week the souls started coming apart.Additionally they have drastically changed the stability and way these shoes roll as you run in the last few models. The heel feels too big and the point in the back is beyond stupid. Nobody strikes so far back that it will make a difference and it lifts your leg too far off the ground when you stretch resulting in your knee trying to turn itself backward.Nike made essentially the same show for 20 years then decided to ruin them. I tried the vomero a few times but they were too cushioned and still had the point in the back. At $50 more and no better it’s not worth it to stay with Nike.
